<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">V</span>IRGIL’S AENEID IS, of course, a major poem; it is also a great and
beautiful one. The scope of an epic requires, in the writing, a designed
variety, a calculated unevenness, now and then some easy-going
carelessness. So the reader win find, here and there, transitional
passages, the stock epithet, the conventional phrase, a few lines of
vamping, and, in this or that line, what the Spanish call <i>ripios</i>. Over
and above these matters of small detail, in the large panorama the
reader will find valleys as well as peaks, dry ravines as well as upland
meadows: the landscape is not always the same height above sea level,
and its flora and fauna vary more than a little. The epic terrain of the
Odyssey differs greatly from that of the Iliad, and both Iliad and
Odyssey differ from the Aeneid, but there is nothing obtrusive in
Virgil’s relatively studied concern with composition. Less wild and
“natural,” the demesnes of the Aeneid have their full measure of more
than pleasant countryside, loftiness also, majesty, grandeur.</p>

<p>Virgil, we have been told, wanted to burn the Aeneid; he was not
satisfied with it. This attitude, it seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span> me, reflects fatigue and
exhaustion of spirit rather than considered literary judgment. The last
revisions are always the most enervating, and Virgil, one can well
believe, having worked on the poem for over a decade, had reached the
point where he felt he would rather do anything, including die, than go
over the poem one more time. If we had never known the poem was believed
incomplete, we would, I think, find it difficult to decide which were
the unsatisfactory portions. Who wants an epic poem absolutely perfect,
anyway? and how could the Aeneid be improved, really?</p>

<p>A charge is brought against the Aeneid that it is propaganda. I do not
know when this criticism first came to be brought; I suspect it is only
our own time, with its persistent devotion to all the aspects of
advertising and sloganeering, that feels sufficiently guilty about these
activities to project the accusation across twenty centuries. Virgil,
with whatever cheerfulness his nature was capable of, would readily have
agreed that the Aeneid was propaganda; but then he did not know the
invidious connotations of the word,&mdash;he would have taken it to mean only
“things that ought to be propagated.” An institute of propaganda
analysis would be completely baffled by the Aeneid; the conclusion might
be that the poem was either the best or the worst propaganda that had
ever been written. What kind of propaganda is it to begin a nationalist
epic with the sorrowful sigh, “It was such a great burden,&mdash;a millstone
around the neck&mdash;to found the Roman race”? What kind of propaganda is it
to make the enemies, by and large, more interesting and sympathetic and
colorful fellows than our own side? Lausus and Mezen<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_ix" id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span>tius, for example,
are a far more engaging father-and-son combination than Aeneas-Anchises,
Aeneas-Ascanius, or Evander-Pallas. Dido and Camilla command our
admiration much more than the blushing Lavinia or the fading Creusa. We
respond to Turnus, and are at best coldly respectful to Aeneas. What
goes on here, anyway? Shouldn’t some patriotic organization investigate
this subversive writer, secretly in the pay of a foreign power? On the
other hand, it is just possible that this is the very best form which
national propaganda can take, the implicit and pervasive doctrine that
great and good as our enemies may be, we can admire them, surpass them,
be just to them, and not be afraid of them, either.</p>

<p>A word or two about the character of Aeneas. It may be that the trouble
with him is really the trouble with us. We are not mature enough to
accept, as epic hero, a man who is imaginative, sensitive, compassionate
(everywhere except in parts of Books IV and X), and, in short,
civilized; in other words, a paradox. There seems to be almost no
aggression at all in the character of Aeneas: even in his dreams he
wants to get out of trouble and avoid fighting. We don’t like this; we
find most satisfactory those moments when he is telling Dido off, or
making bitter sarcastic speeches at Lucagus and Liger. We object,
further, that when he does fight, he knows very well that he is
protected by the gods and by magic armor. (Yet we do not mind the latter
in the case of, for instance, Superman; and would we rather have our
hero sponsored by devils?) In the matter of invulnerability we are, I
think, a little unjust: Virgil takes some pains to show that he can be
hurt:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span> he rushes in, unarmed, to preserve the truce; he is grievously
wounded by the death of Pallas. In any event, we need not feel too
guilty if we are not crazy about Aeneas; there is little in the record
to show that the Romans left enthusiastic encomia, either.</p>

<p>As between Virgil and Homer, there can be no real comparison. Judged by
any standard, Homer is the greater writer; judged by our own, Virgil is
sometimes the better one. His immediate audience consisted of men much
more like ourselves than did Homer’s; and Virgil is considerate of their
special sensitivities in a way that Homer did not have to bother to be.
What he thought he might require of Homer, of course he went and took;
it seems to me that in the taking he always modifies, often, from our
point of view, improves. He will, for one thing, always design and order
more carefully: Book VI, for example, is much more artistically worked
out than the descent to the dead in the Odyssey. And the games in Book
V, though many details are lifted entire from the Iliad, have quite
their own quality, a light-heartedness in the horseplay, a humor and
gaiety entirely different from the uncouth bragging and brawling of the
Homeric competitors. I think it is only literary scholars who could
possibly look down their noses at this book. And in his scenes and
stories of battle Virgil, it seems to me, is far more respectful to the
modern reader’s sense of credulity than Homer is; no student of a work
rather current in 1917, <i>Small Problems of Infantry</i>, would have any
difficulty in understanding what went wrong with the mission of Nisus
and Euryalus in Book IX.</p>

<p>It is too bad that the Aeneid, as a whole, is not better<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi">{xi}</a></span> known in
America. The general practice in our secondary schools has come to be
that of reading Books I, II, IV, and VI, and that’s all. This seems to
me a peculiar way to deal with a work of art, like looking at selected
portions of the Venus of Milo. I do not see how any intelligent American
boys or girls can go this slowly, unless they stop to scan every line,
note every example of synecdoche or synizesis, and parse all the
grammatical constructions, with special attention to the poetical dative
of agent and the Greek middle voice accusative of respect. And where the
impression grew that the last six books are inferior in interest to the
first I do not understand. Virgil, for one, did not think so. <i>Maius
opus moveo.</i></p>

<p>It is a peculiar, paradoxical kind of great poem, this Aeneid. For us, I
think, its greatness can be found in ways that may have had less appeal
to the Roman mind. Its references may mean less, its music more. Not
only the music of the lines, but the music of the whole: this is a
composition, and the pleasure comes in listening to it as one would to a
great symphony (and not too much attention, please, to the program
notes). This is a composition, the Aeneid, beautifully wrought,
beautifully balanced. Professor Conway has written an illuminating essay
dealing with the poem in terms of its architecture; in detail, his
analysis is excellent, but the central metaphor is a little unhappy if
it leads you to envisage the Aeneid as an impressive pile, frozen and
static. The poem <i>moves</i>, in more senses than one: the thing to do is to
feel it and listen to it. Hear how the themes vary and recur; how the
tone lightens and darkens, the volume swells or dies, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span> tempo rushes
or lingers. Take in the poem with the mind, to be sure; take it in with
the eye as well; but above all, hearken to it with the ear.</p>

<p>This translation is a quick and unscrupulous job. I am not being modest:
a modest man would never have started, and a scrupulous one never
finished. I have, nevertheless, been not entirely without principles. I
have been trying to translate the poem, rather than transliterate its
words. In doing so, I have transposed lines, cut some proper names and
allusions where I thought they would excessively slow down reader
interest, substituted the general for the specific or the specific for
the general, and in short taken all kinds of liberties, such as no pure
scholar could possibly approve. But I doubt if there is any such thing
as an absolutely pure scholar, anyhow. A loose iambic pentameter has
seemed to me the most convenient medium, though in some passages, where
the tempo runs faster, you might not recognize it; and I have, by no
means faithfully following Virgil, occasionally used his device of the
half-line. I have preferred solecisms to archaisms: thus I have never
used the second person singular pronoun. I know I have committed
anachronisms, but, then, I know Virgil did too, and I have, in my
opinion heroically, resisted one or two obvious temptations in this
regard. What I have tried to be faithful to is the meaning of the poem
as I understand it, to make it sound to you, wherever I can, the way it
feels to me. Working on it, I have been impressed, more than ever
through the thirty-odd years I have read it, by its richness and
variety: to mention only one point, the famous Virgilian melancholy, the
tone of <i>Sunt lacrimae rerum</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span> is, I begin to notice, a recurring, not
a sustained, theme. There is much more rugged and rough, harsh and
bitter, music in Virgil than you might suspect if you have only read
<i>about</i> him. A recent essay by Mark Van Doren has given me considerable
heart in offering this new translation: there is a kind of scholastic
snobbishness, he points out, in the insistence that no man knows
anything who has not read the classics in the original. It is better, no
doubt, to read Virgil in his own Latin, but still&mdash;I hope some people
may have some pleasure of him, some idea of how good he was, through
this English arrangement.</p>

<span class="i0">Most certain regulation, with a knowledge<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Howls from the north, striking the sail, head on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves are lifted to the stars; the oars<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The roar of storm, and deep and surface mingled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troublesome business, this; he rose, majestic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From under the waves, and saw the Trojan vessels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattered all over the sea by the might of the waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wreck of sky; he recognized the anger<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As Neptune used his trident for a lever,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sometimes, in a great nation, there are riots<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They find a haven, where the water lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With never a ripple. A little island keeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea-swell off, and the waves break on its sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slide back harmless. The great cliffs come down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steep to deep water, and the background shimmers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkens and shines, the tremulous aspen moving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dark fir pointing still. And there is a cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the overhanging rocks, alive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With water running fresh, a home of the Nymphs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With benches for them, cut from the living stone.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Seven weary vessels, and the men are glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be ashore again, to feel dry sand<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hoping for some good luck; the Phrygian galleys<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On a far-off mast-head flying. There is nothing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing to see out yonder, but near the water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three stags are grazing, with a herd behind them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long line browsing through the peaceful valley.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He reaches for the bow and the swift arrows<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Only when seven are slain, a number equal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the ships’ tally, and then he seeks the harbor,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He kept to himself the sorrow in the heart,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Safe to Liburnian regions, where Timavus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roars underground, comes up nine times, and reaches<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Founded a city, Padua, a dwelling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Trojan men, a resting-place from labor,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What a bull’s hide could cover. And now tell me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who you might be yourselves? what land do you come from,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound for what coast?”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">And he began his answer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a long sigh: “O goddess, if I told you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All from the first beginning, if you had leisure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To listen to the record of our trouble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would take me all day long. From ancient Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In case that name means anything, we come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven over many seas, and now a storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has whipped us on this coast. I am Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A good, devoted man; I carry with me<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My household gods, saved from the Greeks; I am known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven; it is Italy I seek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A homeland for me there, and a race descended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From lofty Jove. With a score of ships we started<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the Phrygian ocean, following fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the way my mother pointed. Only seven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are left us now, battered survivors, after<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rage of wind and wave. And here I wander<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wastes of Libya, unknown and needy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven from Europe and Asia.” And his mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke in on his complaining:&mdash;“Whoever you are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some god must care for you, I think, to bring you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here to the city of Carthage. Follow on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go to the royal palace. For, I tell you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your comrades have returned, your fleet is safe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought to good haven by the turn of the winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless the augury my parents taught me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was foolish nonsense. In the heaven yonder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see twelve swans, rejoicing in long column,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattered, a little while ago, and driven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the swooping eagle, over all the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, it seems, they light on land, or watch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who came down before them; as they circle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In company, and make a cheerful sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With whir of wing or song, so, let me tell you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your ships and men already enter harbor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or near it under full sail. Keep on, go forward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the path leads.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">And as she turned, her shoulders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone with a radiant light; her hair shed fragrance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her robes slipped to her feet, and the true goddess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walked in divinity. He knew his mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his voice pursued her flight: “Cruel again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why mock your son so often with false phantoms?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why may not hand be joined to hand, and words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exchanged in truthfulness?” So, still reproachful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He went on toward the city, with Achates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Venus cast dark air around their going,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A veil of mist, so that no man might see them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or lay a hand on them, or halt them, asking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reasons of their coming. She soared upward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Paphos, happily home to temple and altars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steaming with incense, redolent with garlands.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And they went on, where the little pathway led them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rising ground; below them lay the city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Majestic buildings now, where once were hovels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wonder to Aeneas, gates and bustle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well-paved streets, the busy Tyrians toiling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With stones for walls and citadel, or marking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foundations for their homes, drainage and furrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All under ordered process. They dredge harbors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set cornerstones, quarry the rock, where someday<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their theater will tower. They are like bees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In early summer over the country flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sun is warm, and the young of the hive emerge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they pack the molten honey, bulge the cells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the sweet nectar, add new loads, and harry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drones away from the hive, and the work glows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the air is sweet with bergamot and clover.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Happy the men whose walls already rise!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exclaims Aeneas, gazing on the city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And enters there, still veiled in cloud&mdash;a marvel!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And walks among the people, and no one sees him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There was a grove in the middle of the city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most happy in its shade; this was the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where first the Tyrians, tossed by storm and whirlwind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dug up the symbol royal Juno showed them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The skull of a war-horse, a sign the race to come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would be supreme in war and wealth, for ages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dido here was building a great temple<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Juno’s honor, rich in gifts, and blessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the presence of the goddess. Lintel and rafter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were bronze above bronze stairways, and bronze portals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swung on bronze hinges. Here Aeneas first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dared hope for safety, find some reassurance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hope of better days: a strange sight met him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take his fear away. Waiting the queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stood there watching, under the great temple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Letting his eyes survey the city’s fortune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The artist’s workmanship, the craftsman’s labor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, with more than wonder, he sees the battles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fought around Troy, and the wars whose fame had travelled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole world over; there is Agamemnon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Priam, and Menelaus, and Achilles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A menace to them all. He is moved to tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What place in all the world,” he asks Achates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Is empty of our sorrow? There is Priam!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look! even here there are rewards for praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are tears for things, and what men suffer touches<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The human heart. Dismiss your fear; this story<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will bring some safety to you.” Sighing often,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could not turn his gaze away; it was only<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A picture on a wall, but the sight afforded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Food for the spirit’s need. He saw the Greeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard-pressed, in flight, and Trojans coming after,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, on another panel, the scene reversed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achilles in pursuit, his own men fleeing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw, and tears came into his eyes again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tents of Rhesus, snowy-white, betrayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their first sleep by bloody Diomedes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a death, and the fiery horses driven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the camp, before they ever tasted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grass of Troy, or drank from Xanthus’ river.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another scene showed Troilus, poor youngster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Running away, his arms flung down; Achilles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was much too good for him; he had fallen backward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of his car, but held the reins, and the horses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dragged him along the ground, his hair and shoulders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bounding in dust, and the spear making a scribble.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there were Trojan women, all in mourning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With streaming hair, on their way to Pallas’ temple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing, as gift, a robe, but the stern goddess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept her gaze on the ground. Three times Achilles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had dragged the body of Hector around the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was selling it for money. What a groan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came from Aeneas’ heart, seeing that spoil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That chariot, and helpless Priam reaching<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hands, unarmed, across the broken body!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saw himself there, too, fighting in battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against Greek leaders, he saw the Eastern columns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swarthy Memnon’s arms. Penthesilea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Amazon, blazes in fury, leading<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her crescent-shielded thousands, a golden buckle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below her naked breast, a soldieress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fighting with men.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">And as he watched these marvels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one long fascinated stare of wonder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dido, the queen, drew near; she came to the temple<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a great train, all majesty, all beauty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As on Eurotas’ riverside, or where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mount Cynthus towers high, Diana leads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her bands of dancers, and the Oreads follow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thousands, right and left, the taller goddess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The quiver-bearing maiden, and Latona<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is filled with secret happiness, so Dido<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved in her company, a queen, rejoicing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ordering on her kingdom’s rising glory.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Juno’s portal, under the arch of the temple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She took her throne, a giver of law and justice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fair partitioner of toil and duty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suddenly Aeneas, from the crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw Trojan men approaching, brave Cloanthus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sergestus, Antheus, and all those others<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom the black storm had driven here and yonder.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This he cannot believe, nor can Achates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torn between fear and joy. They burn with ardor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek their comrades’ handclasp, but confusion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still holds them in the cloud: what can have happened?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They watch from the cover of mist: men still were coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all the ships, chosen, it seemed, as pleaders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For graciousness before the temple, calling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloud: what fortune had been theirs, he wonders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where had they left the ships; why were they coming?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were given audience; Ilioneus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Senior to all, began: “O Queen, whom Jove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has given the founding of a great new city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has given to bridle haughty tribes with justice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, pitiful Trojans, over every ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven by storm, make our appeal: keep from us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The terrible doom of fire; protect our vessels;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have mercy on a decent race; consider<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our lot with closer interest. We have not come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ravish Libyan homes, or carry plunder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the shore. We lack the arrogance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of conquerors; there is no aggression in us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a place which Greeks have given a name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Land in the West; it is powerful in arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich in its soil; Oenotrians used to live there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, the story goes, a younger people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inhabit it, calling themselves Italians<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After their leader’s name. We were going there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, big with storm and cloud, Orion rising<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drove us on hidden quicksands, and wild winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattered us over the waves, by pathless rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the swell of the surge. A few of us have drifted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here to your shores. What kind of men are these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What barbarous land permits such attitudes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have been denied the welcome of the beach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbidden to set foot on land; they rouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">All kinds of war against us. You despise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may be, human brotherhood, and arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wielded by men. But there are gods, remember,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who care for right and wrong. Our king Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be alive; no man was ever more just,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More decent ever, or greater in war and arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If fate preserves him still, if he still breathes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The welcome air, above the world of shadows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear not; to have treated us with kindly service<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Need bring you no repentance. We have cities<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Sicily as well, and King Acestes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is one of us, from Trojan blood. We ask you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let us beach our battered fleet, make ready<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beams from the forest timber, mend our oarage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek Italy and Latium, glad at knowing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our king and comrades rescued. But if safety<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is hopeless for him now, and Libyan water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has been his grave, and if his son Iulus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is desperate, or lost, grant us permission<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least to make for Sicily, whence we came here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where king Acestes has a dwelling for us.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans, as he ended, all were shouting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dido, looking down, made a brief answer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I am sorry, Trojans; put aside your care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have no more fear. The newness of the kingdom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our strict need compel to me such measures&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sentries on every border, far and wide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who so ignorant as not to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nation of Aeneas, manly both<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In deeds and people, and the city of Troy?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are not as dull as that, we folk from Carthage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun shines on us here. Whether you seek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The land in the west, the sometime fields of Saturn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the Sicilian realms and king Acestes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will help you to the limit; should you wish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To settle here and share this kingdom with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The city I found is yours; draw up your ships;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trojan and Tyrian I treat alike.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would, also, that your king were here, Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven by that same wind. I will send good men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the coast to seek him, under orders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To scour all Libya; he may be wandering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhere, in woods or town, surviving shipwreck.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Aeneas and Achates both were eager<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break the cloud; the queen inspired their spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her address. Achates asked Aeneas:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What do we do now, goddess-born? You see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They all are safe, our vessels and our comrades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only one missing, and we saw him drowning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ourselves, beneath the waves; all other things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confirm what Venus told us.” And as he finished,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cloud around them broke, dissolved in air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Illumining Aeneas, like a god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light radiant around his face and shoulders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Venus gave him all the bloom of youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its glow, its liveliness, as the artist adds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Luster to ivory, or sets in gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silver or marble. No one saw him coming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until he spoke:&mdash;“You seek me; here I am,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trojan Aeneas, saved from the Libyan waves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worn out by all the perils of land and sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In need of everything, blown over the great world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A remnant left by the Greeks, Dido, we lack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The means to thank our only pitier<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For offer of a city and a home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there is justice anywhere, if goodness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Means anything to any power, if gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At all regard good people, may they give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great rewards you merit. Happy the age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy the parents who have brought you forth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While rivers run to sea, while shadows move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the mountains, while the stars burn on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always, your praise, your honor, and your name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever land I go to, will endure.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand went out to greet his men, Serestus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gyas, Cloanthus, Ilioneus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The others in their turn. And Dido marvelled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At his appearance, first, and all that trouble<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had borne up under; there was a moment’s silence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before she spoke: “What chance, what violence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O goddess-born, has driven you through danger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From grief to grief? Are you indeed that son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Venus bore Anchises? I remember<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Teucer came to Sidon, as an exile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking new kingdoms, and my father helped him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father, Belus, conqueror of Cyprus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that time on I have known about your city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your name, and the Greek kings, and the fall of Troy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even their enemies would praise the Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or claim descent from Teucer’s line. I bid you<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enter my house. I, too, am fortune-driven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through many sufferings; this land at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has brought me rest. Not ignorant of evil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know one thing, at least,&mdash;to help the wretched.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so she led Aeneas to the palace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaiming sacrifice at all the temples<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In honor of his welcome, and sent presents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his comrades at the shore, a score of bullocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred swine, a hundred ewes and lambs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In honor of the joyous day. The palace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within, is made most bright with pomp and splendor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The halls prepared for feasting. Crimson covers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are laid, with fine embroidery, and silver<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is heavy on the tables; gold, engraven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recalls ancestral prowess, a tale of heroes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the race’s first beginnings.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being a thoughtful father, speeds Achates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to the ships, with tidings for Iulus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is to join them; all the father’s fondness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is centred on the son. Orders are given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring gifts with him, saved from the Trojan ruins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mantle stiff with figures worked in gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A veil with gold acanthus running through it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once worn by Helen, when she sailed from Sparta<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward that forbidden marriage, a wondrous gift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made by her mother Leda; and the sceptre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Ilione, Priam’s eldest daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had carried once; a necklace hung with pearls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crown of gold and jewels. Toward the ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achates sped the message.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Meanwhile Venus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plotted new stratagems, that Cupid, changed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In form and feature, should appear instead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of young Ascanius, and by his gifts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inspire the queen to passion, with his fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning her very bones. She feared the house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held dubious intentions; men of Tyre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were always two-faced people, and Juno’s anger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vexed her by night. She spoke to her wingèd son:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O my one strength and source of power, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disdainful of Jove’s thunderbolt, to you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I come in prayer for help. You know that Juno<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is hateful toward Aeneas, keeps him tossing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All over the seas in bitterness; you have often<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grieved with me for your brother. And now Dido<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holds him with flattering words; I do not trust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Juno’s ideas of welcome; she will never<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pause at a point like this. Therefore I purpose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take the queen by cunning, put around her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wall of flame, so that no power can change her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that a blazing passion for Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will bind her to us. Listen! I will tell you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How you can manage this. The royal boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My greatest care, has heard his father’s summons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To come to the city, bringing presents, rescued<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the flames of Troy and the sea; and he is ready.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I will make him drowsy, carry him off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In slumber over Cythera, or hide him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep on Idalium in a secret bower<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before he learns the scheme or interrupts it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You, for one night, no more, assume his features,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boy’s familiar guise, yourself a boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that when Dido takes you to her bosom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">During the royal feast, with the wine flowing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And happiness abounding, you, receiving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweetness of her kiss, will overcome her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With secret fire and poison.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Cupid put off his wings, and went rejoicing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With young Iulus’ stride; the real Iulus<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Warm in her bosom to Idalian groves,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For fondling, and her eyes, her heart, receive him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, poor queen, not knowing what a god<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the first quiet settled over the tables,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Runs through the halls, the voices reach the rafters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The burning lamps below the fretted gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The torches flaring, put the night to rout.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen commands the loving-cup of Belus,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Broken in war, set back by fate, the leaders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Greek host, as years went by, contrived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Pallas’ help, a horse as big as a mountain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wove its sides with planks of fir, pretending<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was an offering for their safe return,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least, so rumor had it. But inside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They packed, in secret, into the hollow sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fittest warriors; the belly’s cavern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge as it was, was filled with men in armor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is an island, Tenedos, well-known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich in the days of Priam; now it is only<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bay, and not too good an anchorage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For any ship to trust. They sailed there, hid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the deserted shore. We thought they had gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound for Mycenae, and Troy was very happy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaking off grief, throwing the gates wide open.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a pleasure, for a change, to go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See the Greek camp, station and shore abandoned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, this was where Achilles camped, his minions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Dolopes, were here; and the fleet just yonder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that was the plain where we used to meet in battle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of us stared in wonder at the horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Astounded by its vastness, Minerva’s gift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death from the virgin goddess, had we known it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thymoetes, whether in treachery, or because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fates of Troy so ordered, was the first one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To urge us bring it in to the heart of the city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Capys, and some others, knowing better,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suspicious of Greek plotting, said to throw it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the sea, to burn it up with fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cut it open, see what there was inside it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wavering crowd could not make up its mind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, at that point, Laocoön came running,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a great throng at his heels, down from the hilltop<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fast as ever he could, and before he reached us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried in alarm: ‘Are you crazy, wretched people?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you think they have gone, the foe? Do you think that any<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gifts of the Greeks lack treachery? Ulysses,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was his reputation? Let me tell you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either the Greeks are hiding in this monster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or it’s some trick of war, a spy, or engine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To come down on the city. Tricky business<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is hiding in it. Do not trust it, Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not believe this horse. Whatever it may be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear the Greeks, even when bringing presents.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that, he hurled the great spear at the side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the strength he had. It fastened, trembling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the struck womb rang hollow, a moaning sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had driven us, almost, to let the light in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the point of the steel, to probe, to tear, but something<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Got in his way, the gods, or fate, or counsel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill-omened, in our hearts; or Troy would be standing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Priam’s lofty citadel unshaken.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meanwhile, some Trojan shepherds, pulling and hauling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had a young fellow, with his hands behind him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tied up, and they were dragging him to Priam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had let himself be taken so, on purpose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To open Troy to the Greeks, a stranger, ready<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For death or shifty cunning, a cool intriguer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let come what may. They crowd around to see him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take turns in making fun of him, that captive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listen, and learn Greek trickiness; learn all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their crimes from one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stopped in the middle, frightened and defenceless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked at the Trojan ranks,&mdash;‘What land, what waters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can take me now?’ he cried, ‘There is nothing, nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left for me any more, no place with the Greeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here are the Trojans howling for my blood!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our mood was changed. We pitied him, poor fellow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sobbing his heart out. We bade him tell his story,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lineage, his news: what can he count on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The captive that he is? His fear had gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he began: ‘O King, whatever happens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will tell the truth, tell all of it; to start with,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I own I am a Greek. Sinon is wretched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fortune has made him so, but she will never<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make him a liar. You may perhaps have heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rumors of Palamedes, son of Belus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man of glorious fame. But the Greeks killed him,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was against the war, and so they killed him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An innocent man, by perjury and lying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">False witness. Now that he is dead they mourn him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father, his poor relative, had sent me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To soldier in his company; I was then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarcely beyond my boyhood. Palamedes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held, for some time, some influence and standing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In royal councils, and we shared his glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, and all men know this, Ulysses’ hatred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cunning malice, pulled him down; thereafter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lived in darkness, dragging out a lifetime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sorrow for my innocent lord, and anger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in my anger I was very foolish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I talked; I vowed, if I got home to Argos,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would have vengeance: so I roused Ulysses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hate me in his turn, and that began it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Downfall and evil, Ulysses always trying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To frighten me with hint and accusation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rumors planted where the crowd would listen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh yes, Ulysses knew what he was doing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never stopped, until with Calchas working<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hand in glove with him&mdash;why am I telling this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what’s the use? I am stalling. All the Greeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You think, are all alike; what more do you want?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inflict the punishment. That would be something<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses would rejoice in, and some others<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pay handsome money for!’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But we were all on fire to hear him further.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pelasgian craft meant nothing to our folly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling and nervous, he resumed his lying:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘The Greeks were tired of the long war; they often<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wanted to sail from Troy for home. Oh, would<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they had only done it! But a storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would cut them off, or the wrong wind terrify them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Especially, just after the horse was finished,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the joined planks of maple, all the heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roared loud with storm-clouds. In suspense and terror<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sent Eurypylus to ask Apollo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What could be done; the oracle was gloomy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foreboding: “Blood, O Greeks, and a slain virgin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appeased the winds when first you came here; blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must pay for your return, a life be given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An Argive life.” The word came to our ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With terror in it, our blood ran cold in our veins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whom was fate preparing? who would be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victim of Apollo? Then Ulysses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dragged Calchas into our midst, with a great uproar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trying his best to make the prophet tell us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What the gods wanted. And there were many then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who told me what was coming, or kept silent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they saw, and all too well, the scheme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses had in mind. For ten days Calchas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said nothing at all, hid in his tent, refusing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have a word of his pronounce the sentence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the time Ulysses kept on shouting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Calchas broke, and doomed me to the altar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all assented; what each man had feared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his own case, he bore with great composure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When turned another way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The terrible day was almost on me; fillets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were ready for my temples, the salted meal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepared, the altars standing. But I fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tore myself away from death, I admit it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hid all night in sedge and muddy water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the edge of the lake, hoping, forever hoping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They might set sail. And now I hope no longer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see my home, my parents, or my children,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor things, whom they will kill because I fled them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom they will murder for my sacrilege.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oh, by the gods above, by any power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That values truth, by any uncorrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remnant of faith in all the world, have pity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have pity on a soul that bears such sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than I ever deserved.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had no need to ask us. Priam said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Untie him</i>, and we did so with a promise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spare his life. Our king, with friendly words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Addressed him, saying, ‘Whoever you are, forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Greeks, from now on. You are ours; but tell me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why they have built this monstrous horse? who made it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thought of it? What is it, war-machine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Religious offering?’ And he, instructed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every trick and artifice, made answer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting his hands, now free: ‘Eternal fires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inviolable godhead, be my witness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You altars, you accursèd swords, you fillets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I as victim wore, I had the right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break those solemn bonds, I had the right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hate those men, to bring whatever they hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the light and air; I am bound no longer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To any country, any laws, but, Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep to the promise, if I tell the truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I pay back with interest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the Greek hope, since first the war began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rested in Pallas, always. But Ulysses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crime-contriver, and the son of Tydeus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attacked Minerva’s temple, stole her image<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the holy shrine, and slew the guards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid their bloody hands upon the goddess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from that time the Danaan hopes were broken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faltered and failed. It was no doubtful anger<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas revealed; she gave them signs and portents.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her image in the camp the upraised eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot fire, and sweat ran salty down the limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice from the ground she seemed to flash and leap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With vibrant spear and clashing shield. The priest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calchas, made prophecy: they must take to flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the sea, and Troy could not be taken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without new omens; they must go to Argos,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring back the goddess again, whom they have taken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In curved ships over the sea. And if they have gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are bound for home, Mycenae, for new arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New gods, new soldiers; they will be here again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When least expected. Calchas’ message warned them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so they built this image, to replace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one they had stolen, a gigantic offering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a tremendous sacrilege. It was Calchas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again, who bade them build a mass so mighty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It almost reached the stars, too big to enter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through any gate, or be brought inside the walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if your hands should damage it, destruction,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(May God avert it) would come upon the city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if your hands helped bring it home, then Asia<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When suddenly, over the tranquil deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Tenedos,&mdash;I shudder even now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recalling it&mdash;there came a pair of serpents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With monstrous coils, breasting the sea, and aiming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together for the shore. Their heads and shoulders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose over the waves, upright, with bloody crests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest of them trailing along the water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looping in giant spirals; the foaming sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hissed under their motion. And they reached the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their burning eyes suffused with blood and fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their darting tongues licking the hissing mouths.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale at the sight, we fled. But they went on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight toward Laocoön, and first each serpent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seized in its coils his two young sons, and fastened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fangs in those poor bodies. And the priest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struggled to help them, weapons in his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They seized him, bound him with their mighty coils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice round his waist, twice round his neck, they squeezed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scaly pressure, and still towered above him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straining his hands to tear the knots apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His chaplets stained with blood and the black poison,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He uttered horrible cries, not even human,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More like the bellowing of a bull, when, wounded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It flees the altar, shaking from the shoulder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ill-aimed axe. And on the pair went gliding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the highest shrine, the citadel of Pallas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vanished underneath the feet of the goddess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the circle of her shield.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">The people trembled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again; they said Laocoön deserved it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having, with spear, profaned the sacred image.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It must be brought to its place, they cried, the goddess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must be appeased. We broke the walls, exposing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The city’s battlements, and all were busy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helping the work, with rollers underfoot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ropes around the neck. It climbed our walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deadly engine. Boys, unwedded girls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang alleluias round it, all rejoicing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have a hand on the tow-rope. It came nearer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threatening, gliding, into the very city.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O motherland! O Ilium, home of gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O walls of Troy! Four times it stopped, four times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sound of arms came from it, and we pressed on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unheedful, blind in madness, till we set it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill-omened thing, on the citadel we worshipped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even when Cassandra gave us warning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We never believed her; so a god had ordered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day, our last, poor wretches, we were happy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Garlanding the temples of the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All through the town.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">And the sky turned, and darkness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came from the ocean, the great shade covering earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heaven, and the trickery of the Greeks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprawling along the walls, the Trojans slumbered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep holding their weary limbs, and the Greek armada,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Tenedos, under the friendly silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a still moon, came surely on. The flagship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blazed at the masthead with a sudden signal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sinon, guarded by the fates, the hostile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will of the gods, swung loose the bolts; the Greeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came out of the wooden womb. The air received them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The happy captains, Sthenelus, Ulysses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thessandrus, Acamas, Achilles’ son<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Came sliding down the rope, and Menelaus<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They marshal the determined ranks for battle.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">It was the time when the first sleep begins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For weary mortals, heaven’s most welcome gift.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sleep, before my eyes, I seemed to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hector, most sorrowful, black with bloody dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torn, as he had been, by Achilles’ car,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thong-marks on his swollen feet. How changed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was from that great Hector who came, once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triumphant in Achilles’ spoil, from hurling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire at the Grecian ships. With ragged beard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hair matted with his blood, wearing the wounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He earned around the walls of Troy, he stood there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed that I spoke first:&mdash;‘O light of Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our surest hope, we have long been waiting for you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shores have kept you from us? Many deaths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much suffering, have visited our city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we are tired. Why do I see these wounds?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shame has caused them?’ Those were foolish questions;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He made no answer but a sigh or a groan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then: ‘Alas, O goddess-born! Take flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Escape these flames! The enemy has the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy topples from her lofty height; enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has been paid out to Priam and to country.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could any hand have saved them, Hector’s would have.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy trusts to you her household gods, commending<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her holy things to you; take them, companions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of destiny; seek walls for them, and a city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be established, a long sea-wandering over.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the inner shrine he carried Vesta’s chaplets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his own hands, and her undying fire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Meanwhile, the city is all confusion and sorrow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father Anchises’ house, remote and sheltered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among its trees, was not so far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I could hear the noises, always clearer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thickening din of war. Breaking from sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I climb to the roof-top, listening and straining<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The way a shepherd does on the top of a mountain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fire goes over the corn, and the winds are roaring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the rush of a mountain torrent drowns the fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the happy crops and the work of men and oxen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even drags great trees over. And then I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The truth indeed; the craft of the Greeks was hidden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer from my sight. The house of a neighbor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deiphobus, went up in flames; next door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ucalegon was burning. Sigeum’s water<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave back the glow. Men shouted, and the trumpets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blared loud. I grab my arms, with little purpose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no sense in it, but my heart was burning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mass a band for war, rush to the hilltop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With comrades at my side. Anger and frenzy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurry me on. A decent death in battle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a helpful thought, sometimes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And here came Panthus, running from the weapons,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What stronghold still is ours?’ I had hardly spoken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he began, with a groan: ‘It has come, this day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will be our last, and we can not escape it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trojans we have been, Troy has been, and glory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is ours no more. Fierce Jupiter has taken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Everything off to Argos, and Greeks lord it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a town on fire. The horse, high in the city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pours out armed men, and Sinon, arrogant victor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lights up more fires. The gates are standing open,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men are there by the thousands, ever as many<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As came once from Mycenae; others block<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The narrow streets, with weapons drawn; the blades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flash in the dark; the point is set for murder.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mad with a hopeless passion for Cassandra,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They have left their shrines and altars, and the power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They once upheld is fallen. You are helping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A town already burnt. So let us die,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Dry-jawed, so we went on, through foes, through weapons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To certain death; we made for the heart of the city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black night around us with its hollow shadow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who could explain that night’s destruction, equal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its agony with tears? The ancient city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A power for many years, comes down, and corpses<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Returns to the vanquished heart, and the Greek victors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know what it is to fall. Everywhere sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Everywhere panic, everywhere the image<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Out of a crowd of Greeks comes one Androgeos,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hurry along! Here is plunder for the taking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Others are busy at it, and you just coming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the high ships!’ And then he knew he had blundered;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had fallen in with foes, who gave no answer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stopped, stepped back, like a man who treads on a serpent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen in the rough brush, and then in panic<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draws back as the purple neck swells out in anger.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even so, Androgeos pulled away in terror.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We rush them, swarm all over them; they are frightened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They do not know their ground, and fortune favors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our first endeavor. Coroebus, a little crazy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With nerve and luck, cries out: ‘Comrades, where fortune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First shows the way and sides with us, we follow.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whose plume streams over his head, takes up the shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With proud device, and fits the sword to his side.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Under no gods of ours, in the night’s darkness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wade into many a fight, and Greeks by the dozens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We send to hell. And some of them in panic<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speed to the ships; they know that shore, and trust it,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He threw himself upon them, and he died.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hecuba and her daughters had come thronging,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like doves by a black storm driven. They were praying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here at the altar, and clinging to the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever image was left. And the queen saw Priam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the arms of his youth. ‘O my unhappy husband,’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cried, ‘have you gone mad, to dress yourself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For battle, so? It is all no use; the time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Needs better help than yours; not even my Hector<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could help us now. Come to me, come to the altar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It will protect us, or at least will let us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Die all together.’ And she drew him to her.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Just then through darts, through weapons, came Polites,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A son of Priam, fleeing deadly Pyrrhus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the long colonnades and empty hallways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wounded, and Pyrrhus after him, vicious, eager<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the last spear-thrust, and he drives it home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Polites falls, and his life goes out with his blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father and mother watching. And then Priam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the very grip of death, cried out in anger:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘If there is any righteousness in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To care about such wickedness, the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will have the right reward and thanks to offer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man like this, who has made a father witness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The murder of his son, the worst pollution!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You claim to be Achilles’ son. You liar!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achilles had some reverence, respected<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A suppliant’s right and trust; he gave me back<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Hector’s lifeless body for the tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let me go to my kingdom.’ With the word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He flung a feeble spear, which dropped, deflected<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the rough bronze; it had hung there for a moment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pyrrhus sneered: ‘So, go and tell my father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The latest news: do not forget to mention,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old messenger-boy, my villainous behavior,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what a bastard Pyrrhus is. Now die!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dragged the old man, trembling, to the altar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slipping in his son’s blood; he grabbed his hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the left hand, and the right drove home the sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the side, to the hilt. And so fell Priam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had seen Troy burn and her walls come down, once monarch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud ruler over the peoples and lands of Asia.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lies, a nameless body, on the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dismembered, huge, the head torn from the shoulders.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Grim horror, then, came home to me. I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father when I saw the king, the life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Going out with the cruel wound. I saw Creusa<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsaken, my abandoned home, Iulus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My little son. I looked around. They all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had gone, exhausted, flung down from the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dead in the fire, and I was left alone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And I saw Helen, hiding, of all places,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Vesta’s shrine, and clinging there in silence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the bright flames lit the scene. That hated woman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearing both Trojan anger and Greek vengeance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A common fury to both lands, was crouching<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the altar. Anger flared up in me<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For punishment and vengeance. Should she then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought, come home to Sparta safe, uninjured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walk through Mycenae, a triumphant queen?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See husband, home, parents and children, tended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Trojan slave-girls? This, with Priam fallen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Troy burnt down, and the shore soaked in blood?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never! No memorable name, I knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was won by punishing women, yet, for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There might be praise for the just abolition<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this unholiness, and satisfaction<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vengeance for the ashes of my people.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this I may have said aloud, in frenzy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I rushed on, when to my sight there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vision of my lovely mother, radiant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dark night, a goddess manifest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As tall and fair as when she walks in heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She caught me by the hand and stopped me:&mdash;‘Son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What sorrow rouses this relentless anger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This violence? Do you care for me no longer?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consider others first, your aged father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anchises; is your wife Creusa living?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is Iulus? Greeks are all around them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only my love between them, fire and sword.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not for you to blame the Spartan woman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter of Tyndareus, or even Paris.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods are the ones, the high gods are relentless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is they who bring this power down, who topple<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy from the high foundation. Look! Your vision<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is mortal dull, I will take the cloud away,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear not a mother’s counsel. Where you see<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rock torn from rock, and smoke and dust in billows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neptune is working, plying the trident, prying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The walls from their foundations. And see Juno,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fiercest of all, holding the Scaean gates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Girt with the steel, and calling from the ships<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Implacable companions. On the towers,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn, and be certain&mdash;Pallas takes command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleaming with Gorgon and storm-cloud. Even Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our father, nerves the Greeks with fire and spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spurs the other gods against the Trojans.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hasten the flight, my son; no other labor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waits for accomplishment. I promise safety<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until you reach your father’s house.’ She had spoken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vanished in the thickening night of shadows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dread shapes come into vision, mighty powers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great gods at war with Troy, which, so it seemed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was sinking as I watched, with the same feeling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when on mountain-tops you see the loggers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hacking an ash-tree down, and it always threatens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To topple, nodding a little, and the leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling when no wind stirs, and dies of its wounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one long loud last groan, and dirt from the ridges<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaves up as it goes down with roots in air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divinity my guide, I leave the roof-top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pass unharmed through enemies and blazing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weapons give place to me, and flames retire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">At last I reached the house, I found my father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first one that I looked for. I meant to take him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the safety of the hills, but he was stubborn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refusing longer life or barren exile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Troy was dead. ‘You have the strength,’ he told me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘You are young enough, take flight. For me, had heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wanted to save my life, they would have spared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This home for me. We have seen enough destruction,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than enough, survived a captured city.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak to me as a corpse laid out for burial,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A quick farewell, and go. Death I shall find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my own hand; the enemy will pity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or look for spoil. The loss of burial<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is nothing at all. I have been living too long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hated by gods and useless, since the time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jove blasted me with lightning wind and fire.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would not move, however we wept, Creusa,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascanius, all the house, insistent, pleading<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he should not bring all to ruin with him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would not move, he would not listen. Again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rush to arms, I pray for death; what else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was left to me? ‘Dear father, were you thinking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could abandon you, and go? what son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could bear a thought so monstrous? If the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Want nothing to be left of so great a city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you are bound, or pleased, to add us all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the wreck of Troy, the way is open for it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pyrrhus will soon be here; from the blood of Priam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He comes; he slays the son before the father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sire at the altar-stone; O my dear mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it for this you saved me, brought me through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fire and sword, to see our enemies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in the very house, and wife and son<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And father murdered in each other’s blood?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring me my arms; the last light calls the conquered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me go back to the Greeks, renew the battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall not all of us die unavenged.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Sword at my side, I was on the point of going,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Working the left arm into the shield. Creusa<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clung to me on the threshold, held my feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made me see my little son:&mdash;‘Dear husband,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you are bent on dying, take us with you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if you think there is any hope in fighting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you should know, stay and defend the house!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom are we abandoned, your father and son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, once called your wife?’ She filled the house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With moaning outcry. And then something happened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wonderful portent. Over Iulus’ head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between our hands and faces, there appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A blaze of gentle light; a tongue of flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harmless and innocent, was playing over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The softness of his hair, around his temples.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We were afraid, we did our best to quench it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With our own hands, or water, but my father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised joyous eyes to heaven, and prayed aloud:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Almighty Jupiter, if any prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ours has power to move you, look upon us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grant only this, if we have ever deserved it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grant us a sign, and ratify the omen!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had hardly spoken, when thunder on the left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resounded, and a shooting star from heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew a long trail of light across the shadows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw it cross above the house, and vanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the woods of Ida, a wake of gleaming light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where it had sped, and a trail of sulphurous odor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was a victory: my father rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In worship of the gods and the holy star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying: ‘I follow, son, wherever you lead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no delay, not now; Gods of my fathers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preserve my house, my grandson; yours the omen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Troy is in your keeping. O my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I yield, I am ready to follow.’ But the fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came louder over the walls, the flames rolled nearer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their burning tide. ‘Climb to my shoulders, father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It will be no burden, so we are together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meeting a common danger or salvation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iulus, take my hand; Creusa, follow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little way behind. Listen, you servants!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will find, when you leave the city, an old temple<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That once belonged to Ceres; it has been tended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many years with the worship of our fathers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s a little hill there, and a cypress tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that’s where we shall meet, one way or another.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one thing more: you, father, are to carry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The holy objects and the gods of the household,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My hands are foul with battle and blood, I could not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touch them without pollution.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">I bent down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over my neck and shoulders spread the cover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a tawny lion-skin, took up my burden;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little Iulus held my hand, and trotted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As best he could, beside me; Creusa followed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We went on through the shadows. I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave, so I thought, before, in the rain of weapons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cloud of massing Greeks. But now I trembled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At every breath of air, shook at a whisper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearful for both my burden and companion.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I was near the gates, and thinking we had made it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there was a sound, the tramp of marching feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many of them, it seemed; my father, peering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the thick gloom, cried out:&mdash;‘Son, they are coming!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flee, flee! I see their shields, their gleaming bronze.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something or other took my senses from me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that confusion. I turned aside from the path,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not know what happened then. Creusa<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was lost; she had missed the road, or halted, weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a brief rest. I do not know what happened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was not seen again; I had not looked back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor even thought about her, till we came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Ceres’ hallowed home. The count was perfect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only one missing there, the wife and mother.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom did I not accuse, of gods and mortals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then in my frenzy? What worse thing had happened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the city overthrown? I left Anchises,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My son, my household gods, to my companions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a hiding-place in the valley; and I went back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the city again, wearing my armor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ready, still one more time, for any danger.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found the walls again, the gate’s dark portals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I followed my own footsteps back, but terror,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Terror and silence were all I found. I went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On to my house. She might, just might, have gone there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the Greeks were there, and fire devouring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very pinnacles. I tried Priam’s palace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the empty courtyards Phoenix and Ulysses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guarded the spoils piled up at Juno’s altar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had Trojan treasure there, loot from the altars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great drinking-bowls of gold, and stolen garments,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And human beings. A line of boys and women<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood trembling there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I took the risk of crying through the shadows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over and over, ‘Creusa!’ I kept calling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Creusa!’ and ‘Creusa!’ but no answer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sense, no limit, to my endless rushing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All through the town; and then at last I saw her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or thought I did, her shadow a little taller<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than I remembered. And she spoke to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside myself with terror:&mdash;‘O dear husband,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What good is all this frantic grief? The gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have willed it so, Creusa may not join you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of this city; Jupiter denies it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long exile lies ahead, and vast sea-reaches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ships must furrow, till you come to land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far in the West; rich fields are there, and a river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flowing with gentle current; its name is Tiber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And happy days await you there, a kingdom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A royal wife. Banish the tears of sorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over Creusa lost. I shall never see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The arrogant houses of the Myrmidons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor be a slave to any Grecian woman;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a Dardan woman; I am the wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Venus’ son; it is Cybele who keeps me<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here on these shores. And now farewell, and love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our son.’ I wept, there was more to say; she left me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vanishing into empty air. Three times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I reached out toward her, and three times her image<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled like the breath of a wind or a dream on wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night was over; I went back to my comrades.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I was surprised to find so many more<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mothers, and men, and children, streaming in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From everywhere, looking for me to lead them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherever I would. Over the hills of Ida<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The morning-star was rising; in the town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Danaans held the gates, and help was hopeless.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gave it up, I lifted up my father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together we sought the hills.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“After the gods’ decision to overthrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Asian world, the innocent house of Priam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the proud city, built by Neptune, smoked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the ruined ground, we were driven, different ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By heaven’s auguries, seeking lands forsaken.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below Antandros, under Phrygian Ida,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We built a fleet, and gathered men, uncertain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of either direction or settlement. The summer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had scarce begun, when at my father’s orders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We spread our sails. I wept as I left the harbor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fields where Troy had been. I was borne, an exile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the deep, with son, companions, household,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And household gods.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Far off there lies a land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sacred to Mars; the Thracians used to till it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose king was fierce Lycurgus; they were friendly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of old, to Troy, when we were prosperous. Hither<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sailed, and on its curving shore established<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A city site; Aeneadae, I called it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This I began, not knowing fate was adverse.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I was offering my mother proper homage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other gods, to bless the new beginnings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had a white bull ready as a victim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the king of the gods. There was a mound nearby,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bristling with myrtle and with cornel-bushes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I needed greenery to veil the altar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as I struggled with the leafy branches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fearful portent met my gaze. Black drops<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dripped from the ends of the roots, black blood was falling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the torn ground, and a cold chill went through me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tried again; the shoot resisted; blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed again. Troubled, I prayed to the Nymphs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the father of the fields, to bless the vision,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remove the curse; and down on my knees I wrestled<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A groan from under the hillock, and a voice crying:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Why mangle a poor wretch, Aeneas? Spare me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in the tomb, and save your hands pollution.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know me, I am Trojan-born, no stranger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is familiar blood. Alas! Take flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave this remorseless land; the curse of greed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies heavy on it. I am Polydorus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced by an iron harvest; out of my body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise javelins and lances.’ I was speechless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stunned, in my terror.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Once, to the king of Thrace, with gold for hiding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the king despaired of the siege and the city’s fortune.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My father, too; I told them of the portent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asked for their counsel. All agreed, a land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stained with violence and violation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not for us to dwell in. Southward ho!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Polydorus we made restoration<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Above his outraged mound; dark fillets made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The altar sorrowful, and cypress boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Trojan women loosed their hair in mourning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We offered milk in foaming bowls, and blood<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And cry aloud the voice of valediction.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His temples bound with holy fillets, and laurel.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Apollo’s temple was built of ancient rock,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Was heard. We knelt, most humbly; and a voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to our ears: ‘The land which brought you forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men of endurance, will receive you home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek out your ancient mother. There your house<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And we were joyful and confused, together:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What walls were those, calling the wanderers home?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father, pondering history, made answer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Hear, leaders; learn your hopes. There is a land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called Crete, an island in the midst of the sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">To the Rhoetean shores to found his kingdom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ilium was nothing then, the towers of Troy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undreamed of; men lived in the lowly valleys.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cybele, the Great Mother, came from Crete<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her clashing cymbals, and her grove of Ida<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was named from that original; the silence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her mysterious rites, the harnessed lions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before her chariot wheels, all testify<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Cretan legend. Come, then, let us follow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the gods lead, and seek the Cretan kingdom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not far; with Jupiter to favor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three days will see us there.’ With prayer, he made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most solemn sacrifice, a bull to Neptune,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pestilence and pollution, a deadly year<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My father said, ‘let us return to Delos,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">‘Apollo would tell you this, if you went over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea again to Delos; from him we come<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Great homes for greatness; do not flee the labor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long, long toil of flight. Crete, says Apollo,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Oenotrians lived there once; now, rumor has it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A younger race has called it Italy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the name of a leader, Italus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dardanus came from there, our ancestor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Iasius was. There is our dwelling-place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be happy, then, waken, and tell Anchises<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our certain message: seek the land in the West.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crete is forbidden country.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The vision shook me, and the voice of the gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(It was not a dream, exactly; I seemed to know them,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I woke in a sweat, held out my hands to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poured the pure libation for the altar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, gladly, to Anchises. He acknowledged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own mistake, a natural confusion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our stock was double, of course; no need of saying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We had more ancestors than one. ‘Cassandra,’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anchises said, ‘alone, now I remember,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foretold this fate; it seemed she was always talking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a land in the West, and Italian kingdoms, always.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who ever believed Cassandra? Let us yield<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Leaving this place, where a few stayed, and sailing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hollow keels over the mighty ocean.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">We were in deep water, and the land no longer<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And tempest in it, and the water roughened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shadow; winds piled up the sea, the billows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose higher; we were scattered in the surges.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clouds took away the daylight, and the night<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sails came down, we bent to the oars; the sailors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made the foam fly, sweeping the dark blue water.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was saved from the waves; the Strophades received me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The word means Turning-point in the Greek language),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ionian islands where the dire Celaeno<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other Harpies live, since Phineus’ house<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No fiercer plague of the gods’ anger ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose out of hell, girls with the look of birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bellies fouled, incontinent, their hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like talons, and their faces pale with hunger.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sailed into the harbor, happy to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good herds of cattle grazing over the grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And goats, unshepherded. We cut them down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made our prayer and offering to Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set trestles on the curving shore for feasting.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down from the mountains with a fearful rush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a sound of wings like metal came the Harpies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seize our banquet, smearing dirtiness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over it all, with a hideous kind of screaming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a stinking smell. We found a secret hollow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enclosed by trees, under a ledge of rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where shade played over; there we moved the tables<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lit the fire again; the noisy Harpies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came out of somewhere, sky, or rock, and harried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feast again, the filthy talons grabbing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The taint all through the air. <i>Take arms</i>, I ordered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>We have to fight them</i>. And my comrades, hiding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their shields in the grass, lay with their swords beside them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the birds swooped screaming, and Misenus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounded the trumpet-signal, they rose to charge them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A curious kind of battle, men with sword-blades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the winged obscenities of ocean.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their feathers felt no blow, their backs no wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rose to the sky as rapidly as ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving the souvenirs of their foul traces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the ruined feast. And one, Celaeno,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perched on a lofty rock, squawked out a warning:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Is it war you want, for slaughtered goats and bullocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it war you bring, you sons of liars, driving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The innocent Harpies from their father’s kingdom?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the winds will help you, Italy and her harbors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will reach, all right; but you will not wall the city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, for the wrong you have done us, deadly hunger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will make you gnaw and crunch your very tables!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She flew back to the forest. My companions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were chilled with sudden fear; their spirit wavered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They call on me, to beg for peace, not now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With arms, but vows and praying, filthy birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ill-foreboding goddesses, no matter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anchises prayed with outstretched hands, appeasing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty gods with sacrifice:&mdash;‘Be gracious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great gods, ward off the threats, spare the devoted!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bade us tear the cable from the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shake loose the sails. And a wind sprang up behind us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driving us northward; we passed many islands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zacynthus, wooded, Dulichium, and Same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cliffs of Neritus, Laertes’ kingdom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a curse as we went by for Ithaca,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Land of Ulysses. Soon Leucate’s headland<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came into view, a dreadful place for sailors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Apollo had a shrine. We were very weary<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Burning with sacrifice. We thronged the shore<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The young held bouts, glad that so many islands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held by the Greeks, were safely passed. A year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went by, and icy winter roughened the waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gales from the north. A shield of hollow bronze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne once by Abas, I fastened to the door-posts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set a verse below it: <i>Aeneas won</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>These arms from the Greek victors.</i> I gave the order<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To man the thwarts and leave this harbor; all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obeyed, swept oars in rivalry. We left<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I found her weeping there, and she was startled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the sight of me, and Trojan arms, a shock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too great to bear: she was rigid for a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then lost consciousness, and a long time later<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Managed to speak: ‘Is it real, then, goddess-born?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are you, living messenger or phantom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mortal or ghost? If the dear light has left you,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I found it hard to answer to her tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through my own, but I did say a little:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘I am alive; I seem to keep on living<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all extremes of trouble; do not doubt me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am no apparition. And what has happened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To you, dear wife of Hector? Could any gain<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To even matters at all? Does Pyrrhus still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Presume on you as husband?’ With lowered gaze<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Helenus, with an escort, came from the city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy to recognize us, bringing us in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears and greeting mingled. I went on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing a little Troy, low walls that copied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old majestic ramparts, a tiny river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a dry bed, trying to be the Xanthus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found the Scaean gates, to hold and cling to.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Trojans, too, were fond of the friendly town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose king received them in wide halls; libations<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were poured to the gods, and feasts set on gold dishes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Day after day went by, and the winds were calling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sails filling with a good south-wester.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I put my questions to the king and prophet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘O son of Troy, the god’s interpreter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Familiar with the tripod and the laurel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of great Apollo, versed in stars and omens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bird-song and flying wing, be gracious to me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Without mischance, and all the gods have sent me<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The counsel of their oracles, to follow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Italy and a far-off country; one,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wrath and revolting hunger,&mdash;tell me, prophet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What dangers first to avoid, what presence follow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To overcome disaster?’<br /></span>

<span class="i8">Bullocks slain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With proper covenant, and the chaplets loosened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He led me to the temple of Apollo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very gates, where the god’s presence awed me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where he spoke, with eloquent inspiration:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘O goddess-born, the journey over the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holds a clear sanction for you, under Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who draws the lots and turns the wheel of Fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will tell you some few things, not all, that safely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may go through friendly waters, and in time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come to Ausonian harborage; the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helenus does not know, or, if he did,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Juno would stop his speaking. First of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Italy, which you think is near, too fondly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ready to enter her nearest port, is distant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divided from you by a pathless journey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And longer lands between. The oar must bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the Sicilian ocean, and the ships<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sail on a farther coast, beyond the lakes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an infernal world, beyond the isles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where dwells Aeaean Circe, not till then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can the built city rise on friendly ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep in the mind the sign I give you now:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day, when you are anxious and alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the wave of a hidden river, you will find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the oaks on the shore, a sow, a white one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immense, with a new-born litter, thirty young<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the old one’s udders; that will be the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The site of the city, the certain rest from labor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do not fear the eating of the tables,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fates will find a way, Apollo answer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Avoid this coast of Italy, the lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just westward of our own; behind those walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwell evil Greeks, Narycian Locri, soldiers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Cretan king, Idomeneus; the plains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are full of them; a Meliboean captain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Governs Petelia, a tiny town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Relying on her fortress! Philoctetes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commands her walls. And furthermore, remember,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even when the ships have crossed the sea and anchored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the altars stand on the shore, and the vows are paid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep the hair veiled, and the robe of crimson drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the eyes, so that no hostile visage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May interfere, to gaze on the holy fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or spoil the sacred omens. This rite observe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the generations; keep it holy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that first landing, when the wind brings you down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Sicily’s coast, and narrow Pelorus widens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waters of her strait, keep to the left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Land on the left, and water on the left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long way round; the right is dangerous.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Avoid it. There’s a story that this land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once broke apart&mdash;(time brings so many changes)&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By some immense convulsion, though the lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been one country once. But now between them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea comes in, and now the waters bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Italian coast, Sicilian coast; the tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Washes on severed shores, their fields, their cities.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scylla keeps guard on the right; on the left Charybdis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unappeasable; from the deep gulf she sucks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great waves down, three times; three times she belches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Them high up into the air, and sprays the stars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scylla is held in a cave, a den of darkness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From where she thrusts her huge jaws out, and draws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ships to her jagged rocks. She looks like a girl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair-breasted to the waist, from there, all monster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shapeless, with dolphins’ tails, and a wolf’s belly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better to go the long way round, make turning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond Pachynus, than to catch one glimpse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Scylla the misshapen, in her cavern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rocks resounding with the dark-blue sea-hounds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one thing more than any, goddess-born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tell you over and over: pray to Juno,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give Juno vows and gifts and overcome her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With everlasting worship. So you will come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past Sicily and reach Italian beaches.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will come to a town called Cumae, haunted lakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a forest called Avernus, where the leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rustle and stir in the great woods, and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will find a priestess, in her wildness singing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prophetic verses under the stones, and keeping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Symbols and signs on leaves. She files and stores them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the depth of the cave; there they remain unmoving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keeping their order, but if a light wind stirs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the turn of a hinge, and the door’s draft disturbs them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The priestess never cares to catch them fluttering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the halls of rock, put them in order,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or give them rearrangement. Men who have come there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For guidance leave uncounselled, and they hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Sibyl’s dwelling. Let no loss of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However comrades chide and chafe, however<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind’s voice calls the sail, postpone the visit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this great priestess; plead with her to tell you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her own lips the song of the oracles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She will predict the wars to come, the nations<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Italy, the toils to face, or flee from;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meet her with reverence, and she, propitious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will grant a happy course. My voice can tell you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more than this. Farewell; raise Troy to heaven.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">After the friendly counsel, other gifts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were sent to our ships, carved ivory, and gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heavy silver, cauldrons from Dodona,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A triple breastplate linked with gold, a helmet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shining with crested plume, the arms of Pyrrhus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father, too, has gifts; horses and guides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are added, and sailing-men, and arms for my comrades.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anchises bade the fleet prepare; the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was rising, why delay? But Helenus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke to Anchises, in compliment and honor:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Anchises, worthy of Venus’ couch, and the blessing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of other gods, twice saved from Trojan ruins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yonder behold Ausonia! Near, and far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It lies, Apollo’s offering; sail westward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Am a nuisance with my talking.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And his queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad at the final parting, was bringing gifts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robes woven with a golden thread, a Trojan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarf for Ascanius, all courteous honor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Given with these:&mdash;‘Take them, my child; these are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The work of my own hands, memorials<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hector’s wife Andromache, and her love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive these farewell gifts; they are for one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who brings my own son back to me; your hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your face, your eyes, remind me of him so,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would be just your age.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">I, also, wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I spoke my words of parting: ‘Now farewell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your lot is finished, and your rest is won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No ocean fields to plough, no fleeing fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To follow, you have your Xanthus and your Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Built by your hands, and blest by happier omens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from the path of the Greeks. But we are called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From fate to fate; if ever I enter Tiber<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tiber’s neighboring lands, if ever I see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The walls vouchsafed my people, I pray these shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Italy and Epirus, shall be one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The life of Troy restored, with friendly towns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And allied people. A common origin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A common fall, was ours. Let us remember,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our children keep the faith.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Over the sea we rode, the shortest run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Italy, past the Ceraunian rocks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun went down; the hills were dark with shadow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oars assigned, we drew in to the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a little welcome rest; sleep overcame us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it was not yet midnight when our pilot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprang from his blanket, studying the winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alert and listening, noting the stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wheeling the silent heaven, the twin Oxen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arcturus and the rainy Kids. All calm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw, and roused us; camp was broken; the sail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread to the rushing breeze, and as day reddened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stars faded, we saw a coast, low-lying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made out hills. ‘Italy!’, cried Achates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Italy!’ all the happy sailors shouted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anchises wreathed a royal wine-bowl, stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the high stern, calling:&mdash;‘Gods of earth and ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wind and storm, help us along, propitious<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With favoring breath!’ And the breeze sprang up, and freshened;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw a harbor open, and a temple<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone on Minerva’s headland. The sails came down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We headed toward the land. Like the curve of a bow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The port turned in from the Eastern waves; its cliffs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foamed with the salty spray, and towering rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came down to the sea, on both sides, double walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the temple fled the shore. Here, our first omen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw four horses grazing, white as snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And father Anchises cried:&mdash;‘It is war you bring us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcoming land, horses are armed for war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is war these herds portend. But there is hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of peace as well. Horses will bend to the yoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bear the bridle tamely.’ Then we worshipped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The holy power of Pallas, first to hear us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept our heads veiled before the solemn altar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And following Helenus’ injunction, offered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our deepest prayer to Juno.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And sailed on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some misgiving, past the homes of Greeks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw, next, a bay, Tarentum, and a town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rumor said was Hercules’; against it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The towers of Caulon rose, and Scylaceum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most dangerous to ships, and a temple of Juno.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off, Sicilian Etna rose from the waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we heard the loud sea roar, and the rocks resounding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And voices broken on the coast; the shoals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaped at us, and the tide boiled sand. My father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried in alarm:&mdash;‘This must be that Charybdis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helenus warned us of. Rise to the oars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O comrades, pull from the danger!’ They responded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they did, always, Palinurus swinging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prow to the waves on the left, and all our effort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strained to the left, with oars and sail. One moment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We were in the clouds, the next in the gulf of Hell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times the hollow rocks and reefs roared at us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times we saw spray shower the very stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wind went down at sunset; we were weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drifting, in ignorance, to the Cyclops shores.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There is a harbor, safe enough from wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Etna thunders near it, crashing and roaring,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With swirling pitchy color, and white-hot ashes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">{81}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With balls of flame puffed to the stars, and boulders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain’s guts, belched out, or molten rock<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Through the broken furnace-flues; he shifts his body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every so often, to rest his weariness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then all Sicily seems to moan and tremble<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fill the sky with smoke. We spent the night here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hiding in woods, enduring monstrous portents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unable to learn the cause. There were no stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No light or fire in the sky; the dead of the night,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In hunger’s final stages, reaching toward us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His outstretched hands. We looked again. His beard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unshorn, his rags pinned up with thorns, and dirty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was, beyond all doubt of it, a Greek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one of those who had been at Troy in the fighting.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw, far off, the Trojan dress and armor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stopped short, for a moment, almost started back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In panic, then, with a wild rush, came on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleading and crying:&mdash;‘By the stars I beg you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the gods above, the air we breathe, ah Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take me away from here, carry me off<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To perish at the hands of men.’ He held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our knees and clung there, grovelling before us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We urged him tell his story, his race, his fortune.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Left me behind here, in their terrible hurry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave these cruel thresholds. The Cyclops live here<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With sagging neck, sprawling all over the cavern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belching and drooling blood-clots, bits of flesh,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the step held up with trunk of a pine. No comfort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him, except in the sheep. He reached the sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wading into the sea, and scooped up water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wash the ooze of blood from the socket’s hollow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grinding his teeth against the pain, and roaring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And striding into the water, but even so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves were hardly up to his sides. We fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taking on board our Greek; we cut the cable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strained every nerve at the oars. He heard, and struggled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the splash of the wave, but of course he could not catch us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he howled in a rage, and the sea was frightened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Italy deeply shaken, and all Etna<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rumbled in echoing terror in her caverns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the woods and the thicket of the mountains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cyclops came, the others, toward the harbor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the coast-line. We could see them standing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In impotent anger, the wild eye-ball glaring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grim assortment, brothers, tall as mountains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where oak and cypress tower, in the groves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Jove or great Diana. In our speed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And terror, we sailed anywhere, forgetting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Helenus had said: Scylla, Charybdis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were nothing to us then. But we remembered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In time, and a north wind came from strait Pelorus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We passed Pantagia, and the harbor-mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set in the living-rock, Thapsus, low-lying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">By a secret channel undersea, to join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Arethusan fountains, mingling here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the Sicilian waters. Here we worshipped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The land’s great gods; went on, to pass Helorus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rich and marshy land; and then Pachynus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the cliffs rose sharp and high; and Camerina,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With firm foundation; the Geloan plains,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The wound is fed; she burns with hidden fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His manhood, and the glory of his race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are an obsession with her, like his voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gesture and countenance. On the next morning,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He seems in heart and action! I suppose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It must be true; he does come from the gods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear proves a bastard spirit. He has been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So buffeted by fate. What endless wars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He told of! Sister, I must tell you something:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were not my mind made up, once and for all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never again to marry, having been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So lost when Sychaeus left me for the grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slain by my murderous brother at the altar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were I not sick forever of the torch<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bridal bed, here is the only man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who has moved my spirit, shaken my weak will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I might have yielded to him. I recognize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The marks of an old fire. But I pray, rather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That earth engulf me, lightning strike me down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the pale shades and everlasting night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before I break the laws of decency.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My love has gone with Sychaeus; let him keep it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep it with him forever in the grave.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She ended with a burst of tears. “Dear sister,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dearer than life,” Anna replied, “why must you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grieve all your youth away in loneliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not know sweet children, or the joys of love?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is that what dust demands, and buried shadows?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So be it. You have kept your resolution<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Tyre to Libya, proved it by denying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iarbas and a thousand other suitors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Africa’s rich kingdoms. Think a little.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unfriendly Syrtes, ring us round, and a desert<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barren with drought, and the Barcaean rangers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should I mention Tyre, and wars arising<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of Pygmalion’s threats? And you, my sister,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should you fight against a pleasing passion?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think the gods have willed it so, and Juno<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has helped to bring the Trojan ships to Carthage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a great city, sister, what a kingdom<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Carthage and Troy together in arms, what glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i15">So she fanned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flame of the burning heart; the doubtful mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was given hope, and the sense of guilt was lessened.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And first of all they go to shrine and altar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imploring peace; they sacrifice to Ceres,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Giver of law, to Bacchus, to Apollo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And most of all to Juno, in whose keeping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bonds of marriage rest. In all her beauty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dido lifts up the goblet, pours libation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the horns of a white heifer, slowly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, slowly, moves to the rich altars, noting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proper gifts to mark the day, or studies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sacrificial entrails for the omens.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unhappy Dido burns, and wanders, burning,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With a hunter’s careless arrow in her flank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ranges the uplands, with the shaft still clinging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the hurt side. She takes Aeneas with her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All through the town, displays the wealth of Sidon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buildings projected; she starts to speak, and falters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the end of the day renews the banquet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sends them all home. The stars die out, but Dido<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies brooding in the empty hall, alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abandoned on a lonely couch. She hears him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sees him, or sees and hears him in Iulus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fondles the boy, as if that ruse might fool her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deceived by his resemblance to his father.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The towers no longer rise, the youth are slack<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Walls halt halfway to heaven.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And Juno saw it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen held fast by this disease, this passion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which made her good name meaningless. In anger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rushed to Venus:&mdash;“Wonderful!&mdash;the trophies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The praise, you and that boy of yours are winning!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two gods outwit one woman&mdash;splendid, splendid!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fear Carthage, and suspect us. To what purpose?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What good does all this do? Is there no limit?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would we not both be better off, to sanction<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bond of peace forever, a formal marriage?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have your dearest wish; Dido is burning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With love, infected to her very marrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us&mdash;why not?&mdash;conspire to rule one people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On equal terms; let her serve a Trojan husband;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let her yield her Tyrian people as her dowry.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">This, Venus knew, was spoken with a purpose,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To Libyan shores: not without reservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She spoke in answer: “Who would be so foolish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to refuse such terms, preferring warfare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If only fortune follows that proposal?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This covenant, this mixture? You can fathom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mind, and ask him, being his wife. I follow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherever you lead.” And royal Juno answered:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“That I will tend to. Listen to me, and learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How to achieve the urgent need. They plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas, and poor Dido, to go hunting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When sunlight floods the world to-morrow morning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the rush of the hunt is on, and the forest shaken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With beaters and their nets, I will pour down<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With thunder and threat. The company will scatter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hidden or hiding in the night and shadow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dido and the Trojan come for shelter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the same cave. I will be there and join them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lasting wedlock; she will be his own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bride, forever; this will be their marriage.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Comes to her anxious heart. Her pangs redouble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her love swells up, surging, a great tide rising<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wrath and doubt and passion. “What do I do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What now? Go back to my Numidian suitors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be scorned by those I scorned? Pursue the Trojans?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obey their orders? They were grateful to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once, I remember. But who would let them take me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suppose I went. They hate me now; they were always<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deceivers: is Laomedon forgotten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose blood runs through their veins? What then? Attend them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone, be their companion, the loud-mouthed sailors?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or with my own armada follow after,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wear out my sea-worn Tyrians once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With vengeance and adventure? Better die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Die; you deserve to; end the hurt with the sword.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is your fault, Anna; you were sorry for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Won over by my tears; you put this load<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of evil on me. It was not permitted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems, for me to live apart from wedlock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A blameless life. An animal does better.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I vowed Sychaeus faith. I have been faithless.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, through the night, she tossed in restless torment.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">All things prepared, sure of his going, slumbers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Mercury comes down once more to warn him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Familiar blond young god: “O son of Venus,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And danger rises all around you. Dido,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Certain to die, however else uncertain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While it can still be seized, and hurry, hurry!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea will swarm with ships, the fiery torches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blaze, and the shore rankle with fire by morning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shove off, be gone! A shifty, fickle object<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is woman, always.” He vanished into the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, frightened by that sudden apparition,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas started from sleep, and urged his comrades:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hurry, men, hurry; get to the sails and benches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Get the ships under way. A god from heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again has come to speed our flight, to sever<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Flashed, shining, at the hawser; and all the men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were seized in the same restlessness and rushing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have left the shore, they have hidden the sea-water<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Barce, with an old woman’s fuss and bustle,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wild with her project, the blood-shot eyeballs rolling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale at the death to come, and hectic color<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning the quivering cheeks, broke into the court,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mounted the pyre in madness, drew the sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojan gift, bestowed for no such purpose,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She knew so well, and paused a little, weeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping, and thinking, and flung herself down on it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uttering her last words:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Spoils that were sweet while gods and fate permitted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive my spirit, set me free from suffering.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Happy, I might have been too happy, only<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans made their landing.” She broke off,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rioting, through the shaken town; the palace<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To trick me so? The funeral pyre, the altars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepared this for me? I have, indeed, a grievance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being forsaken; you would not let your sister<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Companion you in death? You might have called me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the same fate; we might have both been taken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One sword, one hour. I was the one who built it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This pyre, with my own hands; it was my voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The town. Let me wash the wounds with water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let my lips catch what fluttering breath still lingers.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She climbed the lofty steps, and held her sister,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dying woman, close; she used her robe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To try to stop the bleeding. And Dido tried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain to raise her heavy eyes, fell back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her wound made a gurgling hissing sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times she tried to lift herself; three times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell back; her rolling eyes went searching heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light hurt when she found it, and she moaned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">At last all-powerful Juno, taking pity,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She had not earned this death, she had only sought it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before her time, driven by sudden madness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, the queen of Hades had not taken<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Meanwhile Aeneas and the fleet were holding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sure course over the sea, cutting the waters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That darkened under the wind. His gaze went back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the walls of Carthage, glowing in the flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Dido’s funeral pyre. What cause had kindled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So high a blaze, they did not know, but anguish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When love is wounded deep, and the way of a woman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With frenzy in her heart, they knew too well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dwelt on with foreboding.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">They were out of sight of land, with only sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around them on all sides, alone with ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ocean and sky, when a cloud, black-blue, loomed over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With night and tempest in it; the water roughened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shadow, and the pilot Palinurus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried from the lofty stern. “What clouds are these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filling the sky? What threat is father Neptune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preparing over our heads? Trim ship,” he ordered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Bend to the oars, reef down the sail.” The course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was changed, on a slant across the wind, and the pilot<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned to Aeneas: “With a sky like this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’d have no hope of reaching Italy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even if Jove himself should guarantee it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds have changed, they roar across our course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the black evening, thickening into cloud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have no strength for headway. Luck is against us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us change the course, and follow. I remember<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fraternal shores near by, the land of Eryx,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sicilian harbors; we were here before<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The uselessness of struggle. Change the course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steer to the land most welcome to me; there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friend Acestes dwells, and there my father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anchises lies at rest. What better land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rest our weary ships?” They made for the harbor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With favoring wind, a swift run over the water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A happy turn to a familiar shore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">High on a hill-top look-out, king Acestes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Son of a Trojan mother and Crinisus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A river-god, saw friendly vessels coming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wonder and delight, came hurrying toward them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a bear-skin over his shoulder, and javelins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bristling in his grasp, and he remembered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old relationship, and gave them welcome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all his rustic treasure, a glad returning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friendly assurance for their weariness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A good night’s rest, and a bright morning followed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the shore Aeneas called his comrades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood on a little rise of ground, and told them:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Great sons of Dardanus, heaven-born, a year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draws to an end, a year ago we buried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father in this land, and consecrated<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrowful altars to his shade. The day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes round again, which I shall always cherish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always lament, with reverence, in the mourning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the gods’ will. If I were held, an exile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the Gaetulian quicksands, or a captive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some Greek ship or city, I would honor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day with solemn rites, and pile the altars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sacrificial offering. But now,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This must be heaven’s purpose&mdash;we have entered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A friendly harbor. Come, then, all of us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us be happy in our celebration,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us pray for winds, and that the god hereafter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive his rites in temples for his honor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Built in the city we found. Two heads of oxen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acestes gives each vessel; bring the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our own household, and the ones Acestes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pays worship to. Nine days from now, if dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes bright and shining over the world of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There will be games, a contest for the boats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A foot-race, javelin-throw or archery, a battle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rawhide gloves; let all attend, competing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For victory’s palm and prize. And now, in silence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Garland the brow with leaves.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">He bound his temples<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Venus’ myrtle, and the others followed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acestes, Helymus, and young Iulus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the other lads, and Aeneas, from the meeting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved to Anchises’ tomb, and many thousands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came thronging there. He poured libation, duly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bowls of pure wine, and milk, and victim-blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strewed bright flowers, praying: “Holy father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hail, once again; hail once again, O ashes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regained in vain; hail, holy shade and spirit!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hail, from a son, destined to seek alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fated fields, Italian soil, alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek, whatever it is, Ausonian Tiber.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As rainbow gives to cloud, when the sun strikes it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas stood amazed; and the great serpent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crawled to the bowls and cups, tasted the offerings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slid again, without a hint of menace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the altar-stone. Intent, Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resumed the rites; the serpent might have been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all he knew, a guardian of the altar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or some familiar spirit of Anchises.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two sheep he sacrificed, two swine, two heifers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured wine, invoked the spirit of his father,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Also bring gifts, whatever they can, slay bullocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Load altars high; others prepare the kettles,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With eagerness, bright and clear, and the crowd gathered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under Acestes’ sanction; they were eager<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the Trojans, or to join the contests.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were the prizes, tripods, and green garlands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And palms for the winners, armor, crimson garments,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talents of silver and gold. And a trumpet heralds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The start of the games.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">For the first contest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four ships are entered, heavy-oared, and chosen,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His ship the <i>Dragon</i>, and his crew is eager,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Later the Memmian line will call him father).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gyas commands the big <i>Chimaera</i>, a vessel<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Cloanthus leads. (The Sergian house at Rome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descends from one, Cluentians from the other.)<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Far out in the water, facing the foaming shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lies a rock, which the swollen waves beat over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On stormy days when gales blot out the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But quiet in calm weather, a level landing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the sun-loving sea-gulls. Here Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sets a green bough of holm-oak, as a signal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mark the turning-point; to this the sailors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must row, then turn, and double back. The places<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are chosen by lot; the captains are set off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shining in gold and purple; all the sailors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wear poplar-wreaths, and their naked shoulders glisten<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the smear of oil. They are at their places, straining<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arms stretched to the oars, waiting the word, and their chests<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heave, and their hearts are pumping fast; ambition<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nervousness take hold of them. The signal!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shoot away; the noise goes up to the heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The arms pull back to the chests, the water is churned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a foam like snow; the start is very even,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea gapes open under the rush of the beaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pull of the oars. The racers go no faster<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the chariots take the field, and the barrier springs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cars into action, and the drivers lash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whipping and shaking the reins. Applause and shouting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Volley and ring, and shrill excitement rises<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From some with bets on the issue; all the woodland<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resounds, the shores are loud, and the beaten hillside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sends back the uproar.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Gyas beats the others<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the rush of the starting sprint; Cloanthus follows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a better crew, but a slower, heavier vessel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind them come the <i>Dragon</i> and the <i>Centaur</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With no advantage either way; first one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the other, has it, moving even<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With long keels through salt water; and the leader<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has almost reached the rock, the turn; that’s Gyas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The captain, yelling loudly at his pilot:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Menoetes, what the hell! Why are you steering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So far off to the right? Bring her in closer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This way, let the oars just miss the rocks, hug shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut her close here on the left; let the other fellows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stay out as far as they like.” Menoetes, though,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feared unseen rocks, and made for open water.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Why so far off the course? The rock, Menoetes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep close to the rock!” And while he shouted, Gyas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could see Cloanthus coming up behind him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inside him, on the left, and gaining, gaining.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the roar of the rock and the ship of Gyas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cloanthus grazed his way, and passed the leader,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made the turn safely, and reached open water.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Gyas really was burnt up; he was crying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In rage; to hell with pride, to hell with safety!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He grabbed that cautious pilot of his, and heaved him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the stern, he took the rudder over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steering for shore, and yelling at the sailors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As old Menoetes slowly came to the surface,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heavy garments dripping, clawing and scrambling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the top of the rock, to perch there, drying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A good laugh for the Trojans, as they watched him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taking his header, coming up, and swimming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spitting out salt water.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">The two last ones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mnestheus and Sergestus, were encouraged;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gyas was easy now; Sergestus managed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To get ahead, a little; he neared the rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less than a length ahead; the rival <i>Dragon</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was lapped on him, and up and down, amidships,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went Mnestheus, cheering on his crew:&mdash;“Get going,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise to the oars, my comrades, men of Hector<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom I picked out for mine in Troy’s last moment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show the old spirit and the nerve that took us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the Gaetulian sands, Ionian waters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Off Cape Malea! We can’t hope to win it,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whatever we do, don’t come in last! We could not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear any such disgrace.” They did their utmost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straining with all their might, the bronze deck shaking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the effort, and the quiet ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streamed under and past them. Arms and legs were weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wobbly, shaking; breath came hard, they gulped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gasped for air, and sweat ran down in rivers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they had some luck. Sergestus, out of his senses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drove in, too close, and piled up on the rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which almost bounced as he hit there, and the oars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were sheared away, and the bow hung up, and the sailors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouting like mad, pushed hard with pikes or boat-hooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the wreck of the oars, to shove them off. And Mnestheus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Easier now, and with exalted spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From this much victory, with a prayer to the winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the oars’ swift drive, was running down-hill waters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the open ocean, as a dove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly startled out of her nest in a cavern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the young brood waits, wings to the fields in fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flapping on anxious pinions, and recovers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And skims down peaceful air, with never a motion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wing in the lifting air, so Mnestheus sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sped the <i>Dragon</i>, racing home, and the sweep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her own speed made a wind. She passed Sergestus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struggling, rock-bound, in shallow water, howling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For help, in vain, and learning how to manage<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121">{121}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A boat when the oars are broken. She overhauled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gyas, in the <i>Chimaera</i>, wallowing heavy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a pilot. Only Cloanthus was left;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were after him with all their might, the clamor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose twice as loud; they were cheering the pursuer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sky was a crash of shouting. On the <i>Scylla</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They would give their lives to hold their place, they have won it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glory and honor are theirs already, almost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mnestheus’ men take courage from their nearness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They can because they think they can. They would have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, or tied, at least had not Cloanthus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taken to prayer:&mdash;“Gods of the seas, whose waters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I skim, whose empire lifts me up, I gladly<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the entrails flung to the flood!” Under the waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Nereids heard him, Phorcus, Panopea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maiden, and Portunus, the big-handed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boosted him on his way. Swifter than arrow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Diores, of the royal house of Priam,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Patron, Tegean-born; and two Sicilians,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Panopes, Helymus, trained to the forests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Companions of Acestes; and many others<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For second place, an Amazonian quiver<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Thracian arrows, a broad belt of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With jeweled buckle; and this Argive helmet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the one who comes in third.”<br /></span>

<span class="i15">They take their places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the signal is given, away they go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like rain from storm-cloud, bodies leaning forward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyes on the goal. And for the lead it’s Nisus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swifter than winds or lightning; running second,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A good way back, comes Salius; and the third one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Third at some distance, is Euryalus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helymus next; right on his heels Diores.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s a little crowding there, the course too narrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diores, full of run, is in a pocket,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He can’t get through. The race is almost over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their breath comes hard, they are almost at the finish,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s a pool of blood on the ground, where the slain bullocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell in the sacrifice, a slippery puddle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red on green ground, and Nisus does not see it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nisus, still leading, thinking himself the winner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is out of luck, his feet slide out from under,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wobbles, totters, recovers himself a little,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slips and goes forward, in a beautiful header<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through blood and mud. But he keeps his wits about him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does not forget his friend Euryalus; rising,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sort of accidentally on purpose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gets in the way of Salius and spills him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cartwheel, head over heels on the flying sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Euryalus flashes past, an easy winner<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thanks to his friend’s assistance, and they cheer him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helymus second; in third place, Diores.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Immediately there’s a loud howl of protest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salius shrieking in the elders’ faces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cries of <i>Foul!</i> and <i>Outrage!</i> “I was robbed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">{125}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me first prize!” But all the popular favor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sides with Euryalus, who is young, and weeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And better-looking; and Diores backs him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loudly, of course, since who would get the helmet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Salius was first? Aeneas ends it:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The race will stand as run; you get your prizes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As first proposed; no one will change the order;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one thing I can do, and will do,&mdash;offer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A consolation to our innocent friend.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this, he gives a lion-skin to Salius,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy with shaggy hair, and the claws gilded.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nisus is heard from:&mdash;“If you’re giving prizes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For falling down, what’s good enough for Nisus?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would have won it surely, only Fortune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave me the same bad deal she handed Salius!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the words he made a sudden gesture<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showing his muddy face. Aeneas, laughing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ordered another prize, a shield for him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The work of Didymaon, stolen by Greeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Neptune’s temple sometime, but recovered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A worthy prize for a distinguished hero.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Next is a boxing-bout. “Whoever has courage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fighting spirit in his heart, step forward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put the gloves on!” There are double prizes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the winner a bullock, decked with gold and ribbons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sword and shining helmet for the loser.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without delay, Dares gets up; a murmur<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs through the crowd as this big man comes forward.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They know that he was Paris’ sparring-partner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they recall his famous match with Butes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Hector’s tomb, where he knocked out that champion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stretched him dying on the yellow sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Dares holds his head up for the battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shakes his broad shoulders loose, warms up a little,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A left, a right, a left, in shadow-boxing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who will oppose him? No one puts the gloves on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No one, from all that throng, is in a hurry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take on Dares. So, exultant, thinking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself a winner by default, he grabs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bullock by one horn, says to Aeneas:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“If no man, goddess-born, is taking chances,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How long must I keep standing here? How long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hang around waiting? Give the order, let me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lead home my prize!” The Trojans all applaud him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But king Acestes, sprawling on the greensward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside Entellus, nudges him a little:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What was the use, Entellus, of being a hero,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of having been our bravest, under Eryx?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is that old Sicilian reputation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all those prizes hanging from the rafters?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does Dares get away with this, no contest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all those prizes, and you sit here tamely?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entellus answers, “Oh, I still love glory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And praise; there’s nothing the matter with my courage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I’m too old, the blood is slow and colder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strength not what it used to be. That bragger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has one thing, youth, and how he revels in it!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I had what he has, I’d not need prizes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bullocks or helmets either, to get me fighting.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From somewhere he produced the gloves of Eryx<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tossed them into the ring, all stiff and heavy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven layers of hide, and insewn lead and iron.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people stand amazed, and Dares shudders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wanting no part of gloves like these; Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inspects them, turning them slowly, over and over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And old Entellus adds a word of comment:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Why, these are nothing! What if you had seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gloves of Hercules? He used to fight here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are the gloves that Eryx wore against him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You still can see the blood and a splash of brains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stained them long ago. I used to wear them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself when I was younger, and unchallenged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Time, that envious rival. But if Dares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Declines these arms, all right, make matters equal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don’t be afraid; I waive the gloves of Eryx,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You put the Trojan gloves aside; Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will see fair play, Acestes be my second.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He throws the double cloak from off his shoulders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strips down to the great limbs, great bones, great muscles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A giant in the ring. Aeneas brings them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matched pairs of gloves.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">They take their stand, each rising<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the balls of his feet, their arms upraised, and rolling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their heads back from the punch. They spar, they lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They watch for openings. Dares, much the younger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is much the better in footwork; old Entellus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has to rely on strength; his knees are shaky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wind not what it was. They throw their punches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many miss; and some, with a solid thump,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128">{128}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Land on the ribs or chest; temples and ears<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When a punch lands. Entellus stands flat-footed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wasting no motion, just a slip of the body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The watchful eyes alert. And Dares, feinting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one who artfully attacks a city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tries this approach, then that, dancing around him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In varied vain attack. Entellus, rising,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draws back his right (in fact, he telegraphs it),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dares, seeing it coming, slips aside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entellus lands on nothing but the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, thrown off balance, heavily comes down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flat on his face, as falls on Erymanthus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thunder-smitten oak, and so on, and so on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roaring, the Trojans and Sicilians both<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise to their feet; the noise goes up to heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acestes rushes in, to raise his comrade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In pity and sorrow. But that old-time fighter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not slowed down a bit, nor made more wary;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rage is terrible, and his shame awakens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A consciousness of strength. He chases Dares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All over the ring, left, right, left, right, the punches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rattle like hailstones on a roof; he batters Dares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spins him halfway around with one hand, clouts him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight with the other again. At last Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steps in and stops it, with a word of comfort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the exhausted Dares:&mdash;“Luckless fellow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yield to the god! What madness blinds your vision<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strength beyond your own?” They rescue Dares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drag him to the ships, with his knees caving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129">{129}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Head rolling side to side, spitting out blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And teeth; he hardly sees the sword and helmet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They leave the palm and bullock for Entellus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, in the pride of victory, cries aloud:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Look, goddess-born! Watch, Trojans, and discover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two things&mdash;how strong I was when I was younger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what a death you’ve kept away from Dares!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with the word, he faced his prize, the bullock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew back his right hand, poised it, sent it smashing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the horns, shattering the skull, and splashing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brains on the bones, as the great beast came down, lifeless.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“This life, a better one than Dares’, Eryx,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I vow as sacrifice, and so, victorious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retire, and lay aside the gloves forever.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Next comes an archery contest. Aeneas offers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prizes and summons; on Serestus’ vessel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mast is raised, and from its top a cord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a fluttering dove bound to it as the mark.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four enter; a bronze helmet takes the lots,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hippocoön’s leaps out first; then Mnestheus follows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green with the olive garland, sign and token<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ship well driven; and third was Pandarus’ brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eurytion; Pandarus was the archer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who once broke truce with the Greeks, firing an arrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the days of peace; and last came king Acestes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Willing to try his hand with younger men.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">They bend the pliant bows, each archer straining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draw shaft from quiver. First from the twanging string<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hippocoön’s arrow flew, through sky, through wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reaching its mark in the wood of the mast, which trembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">{130}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bird flapped wings in terror, and the crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang with applause. Mnestheus took his stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawing the bow back, aiming a little higher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And missed the bird, but severed knot and tether,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dove sped free to the south. Eurytion, waiting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ready, called in prayer upon his brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the dart fly, brought down the bird, exulting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From under the dark of the cloud. She came down lifeless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced by the arrow still. No prize was left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For king Acestes, but he fired his arrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High as he could, to prove his skill. And a wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to their eyes; it proved an omen later<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When seers explained its meaning. The shaft caught fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flying amid the clouds, a course of flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vanishing into space, as comets stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeping across the heaven, their long train flying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind them through the sky. All hearts were shaken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sicilian, Trojan, both, and all men prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the powers on high. Aeneas hailed the omen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embraced Acestes, loaded him with presents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, “Receive them, father; for the king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heaven has willed it so, unusual honors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For skill surpassing. This bowl, with graven figures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anchises owned, given him by a Thracian,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Cisseus, memorial and token,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of everlasting friendship.” On his brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bound green laurel, hailing Acestes victor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the rest, and no one grudged the honor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not even Eurytion, who had shot the dove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mnestheus, for the cutting of the tether,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took his reward, and the one who hit the mast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hippocoön, was not forgotten either.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But while the shoot was on, Aeneas called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Epytides, Iulus’ guardian, to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With words for a loyal ear:&mdash;“Go, tell Iulus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the boys are ready, and the horses marshalled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lead them, for Anchises’ sake, presenting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself in arms.” And he bade the throng draw back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving the long course clear and the field open.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boys rode in, shining on bridled ponies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before their fathers’ eyes, in true formation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a murmur of delight. The garlands weighed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young hair down, they carried cornel spear-wands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With iron at the tip; and some had quivers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright-polished, at their shoulders; torques of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looped high on the breast in pliant rings. Three leaders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led, each, three squadrons, and a dozen followed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each gay young captain. One of them was Priam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Son of Polites, and King Priam’s grandson,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a piebald Thracian, white of brow and fetlock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Atys led another line&mdash;(The Atii,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Latium, claim descent from him)&mdash;young Atys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iulus’ special friend. And last, most handsome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iulus rode a Carthaginian courser,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Queen Dido’s gift. Sicilian horses carried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other riders, who rode up to the cheering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shy, as they heard the sound, and the fond welcome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of crowds that saw the fathers in the children.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rode full circle once, and then a signal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crack of the whip, was given, and they parted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into three groups, went galloping off, recalled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wheeled, made mock charge, with lances at the ready,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made march and counter-march, troops intermingled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With troops, to right and left, in mimic battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mimic retreat, and mimic peace, a course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confusing as the Labyrinth in Crete<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose path runs through blind walls, where craft has hidden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand wandering ways, mistake and error<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threading insoluble mazes, so the children,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sons of Troy, wove in and out, in conflict<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In flight and sport, as happy as dolphins leaping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the Carpathian waters. This was a custom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascanius, when grown, himself established<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Alba Longa, his own town, and taught there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What he had learned in boyhood, and the Albans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In turn informed their children, and the Romans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep this ancestral rite; the boys are Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the game Trojan, to this very day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From its first observance, in Anchises’ honor.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Here fortune changed, not keeping faith; for Juno,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the ritual of sport went on, sent Iris,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a fair wind, to the Trojan fleet. She was angry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, and the ancient grudge unsatisfied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Iris, over her thousand-colored rainbow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran her swift path, unseen, beheld the crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surveyed the shore, harbor and fleet deserted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While far off on the lonely coast the women<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mourned for Anchises lost, weeping and watching<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unfathomable deep. “For weary people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! how much remains, of shoal and ocean!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So ran the common sigh. They crave a city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are tired of bearing the vast toil of sailing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into their midst came Iris, versed in mischief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laying aside her goddess-guise, becoming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Beroe, Doryclus’ wife, who sometime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had children, fame, and lineage. Now Iris,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resembling her, came down to the Trojan mothers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Alas for us!” she cried, “on whom the Greeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never laid hands, to drag us down to death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before our native walls! Unfortunate people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what is fortune saving us, what doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What dying? It is seven weary summers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Troy’s destruction, and still we wander over<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Implacable, as we go on pursuing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A land that flees forever over the waters.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here lived our brother Eryx, here we find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A welcomer, king Acestes; who forbids us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To found the walls, to build our city here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O fatherland, O household gods in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saved from the Greeks, will there never be any walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Troy again? No Simois or Xanthus,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">These vessels of ill-omen. Let me tell you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have been given warnings; in a dream<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">She was the first to seize a brand; she raised it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above her head, and swung it, streaming and glowing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flung it forth. The women, for a moment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood in bewilderment, and one, the oldest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Named Pyrgo, nurse to Priam’s many children,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried out:&mdash;“This is no Beroe, I tell you,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her stride, her features; every mark of the goddess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attends her presence. Beroe I myself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have just now come from; she lies ill and grieving<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From reverence for Anchises.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">As they gazed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The air on her bright pinions, rose to heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were shaken then, amazed, and frenzy-driven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cried aloud; tore fire from the hearths and altars;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As when he led the games, rushed to the trouble<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fast as he could ride; no troubled masters<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could hold him back. “Poor things, what are you doing?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Your own Ascanius!” And before their feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He flung the helmet he had worn when leading<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little war-game. And Aeneas hurried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With others to the troubled camp. The women<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattered and fled along the shore, in terror<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And guilt, wherever they could, to hiding-places<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In woods or caves in the rock; they are ashamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of daylight and their deed; Juno is shaken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of their hearts, and they recognize their own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That does not stop the fire; it burns in fury<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under wet oak, tow smoulders, and the stubborn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steam eats the keels away, destruction seizing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On deck and hull, and water can not quench it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor any strength of men. Tearing his garment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loose from his shoulders, Aeneas prays to heaven:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Almighty Jove, if the Trojans are not hateful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the last man, if any record of goodness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alleviates human trouble, let our fleet<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And now Aeneas, stunned by the bitter evil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was troubled at heart, uncertain, anxious, grieving:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What could be done? forget the call of the fates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And settle here in Sicily, or keep on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the coast of Italy? An old man, Nautes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Pallas had instructed in deep wisdom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave him the answer. “Goddess-born, wherever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fate pulls or hauls us, there we have to follow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever happens, fortune can be beaten<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By nothing but endurance. We have here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A friend, Acestes, Trojan-born, divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In parentage; make him an ally in counsel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Partner in enterprise; to him hand over<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sick and tired, the old men, and the mothers<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The old man’s words still troubled him; the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was torn this way and that. Night rode the heavens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her dark chariot, and there came from the darkness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The image of Anchises, speaking to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In words of comfort:&mdash;“Son, more dear to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than life, when life was mine; son, sorely troubled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Trojan fate, I come at Jove’s command,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">But meanwhile Venus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven by worry, went to Neptune, pouring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Complaints from a full heart:&mdash;“Neptune, the anger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Juno, her insatiable vengeance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which neither time nor any goodness softens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drives me to humble prayer. She never weakens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Jove’s command, nor the orders of the fates;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not enough for her that the Trojan city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is quite consumed by hatred, and the remnants<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that poor town harried all over the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every kind of punishment; she still follows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even their bones and ashes. She may know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reasons for that wrath of hers. Remember<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How great a weight of water she stirred up lately<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the Libyan seas, confusing sky and ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Aeolus conspiring, and in your kingdom!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now her crime has driven the Trojan mothers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To burn their ships, to give their comrades over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a coast unknown. Let what is left come safely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the sea, to reach Laurentian Tiber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If what I ask is just, if those are walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Due them by fate’s decree.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And Neptune answered:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“None has a better right to trust my kingdom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the goddess born of the sea-foam. And I have earned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This confidence. I have often checked the anger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sea and sky. And the rivers of Troy are witness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have helped on land as well, and saved Aeneas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thousands died at Troy, with fierce Achilles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hot pursuit, and the rivers groaned, and Xanthus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could hardly find the sea, I formed a cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around Aeneas, when he met Achilles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the gods adverse, and no great strength to help him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rescued him, in spite of my own anger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the perjury of Troy, in spite of my passion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raze the walls I had built. Now too my purpose<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The haven of Avernus; the prayer is granted.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">This comfort given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring the goddess joy, he yoked his horses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold bridle, foaming bit, and sent them flying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the lightest touch of the reins, skimming the surface<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the bright blue car; and the waves went down, the axle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subdued the swell of the wave, and storm-clouds melted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To nothing in the sky, and his attendants<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed along, great whales, and ancient Glaucus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Palaemon, Ino’s son, and the rushing Tritons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The army of Phorcus, Melite and Thetis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching the left, and the maiden Panopea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cymodoce and Thalia and Spio,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that Aeneas, in his turn, was happy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less anxious at heart. The masts are raised, and sail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched from the halyards; right and left they bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The canvas to fair winds: at the head of the fleet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rides Palinurus, and the others follow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ordered, close behind him; dewy night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has reached mid-heaven, while the sailors, sleeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Relax on the hard benches under the oars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All calm, all quiet. And the god of Sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parting the shadowy air, comes gently down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking for Palinurus, bringing him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A guiltless man, ill-omened dreams. He settles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the high stern, a god disguised as a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speaking in Phorbas’ guise, “O Palinurus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fleet rides smoothly in the even weather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141" id="page_141">{141}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hour is given for rest. Lay down the head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rest the tired eyes from toil. I will take over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little while.” But Palinurus, barely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting his eyes, made answer: “Trust the waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However quiet? trust a peaceful ocean?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put faith in such a monster? Never! I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have been too often fooled by the clear stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To trust Aeneas to their faithless keeping.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so he clung to the tiller, never loosed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand from the wood, his eyes from the fair heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo, the god over his temples shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bough that dripped with dew from Lethe, steeped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Stygian magic, so the swimming eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against his effort close, blink open, close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again, and slumber takes the drowsy limbs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bending above him, leaning over, the god<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoves him, still clinging to the tiller, calling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His comrades vainly, into the clear waves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the god is gone like a bird to the clear air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fleet is going safely over its journey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Neptune promised. But the rocks were near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Siren-cliffs, most perilous of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White with the bones of many mariners,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud with their hoarse eternal warning sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas starts from sleep, aware, somehow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a lost pilot, and a vessel drifting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself takes over guidance, with a sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heartache for a friend’s mishap, “Alas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too trustful in the calm of sea and sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Palinurus, on an unknown shore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Paying Apollo homage, the dedication<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pasiphae in cruel love, the bull<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She took to her by cunning, and their offspring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mongrel Minotaur, half man, half monster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proof of lust unspeakable; and the toil<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which no one could have solved, but Daedalus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pitied a princess’ love, loosened the tangle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave her a skein to guide her way. His boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Icarus, might have been here, in the picture,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Once, and once more, and dropped his hands; he could not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Master his grief that much. The story held them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They would have studied it longer, but Achates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came from his mission; with him came the priestess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deiphobe, daughter of Glaucus, who tends the temple<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Phoebus and Diana; she warned Aeneas:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“It is no such sights the time demands; far better<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To offer sacrifice, seven chosen bullocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven chosen ewes, a herd without corruption.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were prompt in their obedience, and the priestess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Summoned the Trojans to the lofty temple.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The rock’s vast side is hollowed into a cavern,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a hundred mouths, a hundred open portals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence voices rush, the answers of the Sibyl.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had reached the threshold, and the virgin cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“It is time to seek the fates; the god is here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The god is here, behold him.” And as she spoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the entrance, her countenance and color<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changed, and her hair tossed loose, and her heart was heaving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her bosom swollen with frenzy; she seemed taller,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her voice not human at all, as the god’s presence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew nearer, and took hold on her. “Aeneas,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cried, “Aeneas, are you praying?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are you being swift in prayer? Until you are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The house of the gods will not be moved, nor open<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its mighty portals.” More than her speech, her silence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made the Trojans cold with terror, and Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prayed from the depth of his heart: “Phoebus Apollo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compassionate ever, slayer of Achilles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through aim of Paris’ arrow, helper and guide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the seas, over the lands, the deserts,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Attend our wandering. And spare us now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All of you, gods and goddesses, who hated<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy in the past, and Trojan glory. I beg you,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The future stands revealed, grant that the Trojans&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ask with fate’s permission&mdash;rest in Latium<br /></span>

<span class="i2">But the priestess, not yet subject to Apollo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went reeling through the cavern, wild, and storming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To throw the god, who presses, like a rider,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bit and bridle and weight, tames her wild spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shapes her to his control. The doors fly open,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hundred doors, of their own will, fly open,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the air the answer comes:&mdash;“O Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last the dangers of the sea are over;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That course is run, but graver ones are waiting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On land. The sons of Dardanus will reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kingdom of Lavinia&mdash;be easy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that account&mdash;the sons of Dardanus, also,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will wish they had not come there. War, I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Terrible war, and the river Tiber foaming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With streams of blood. There will be another Xanthus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another Simois, and Greek encampment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even another Achilles, born in Latium,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself a goddess’ son. And Juno further<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will always be there: you will beg for mercy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be poor, turn everywhere for help. A woman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will be the cause once more of so much evil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A foreign bride, receptive to the Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A foreign marriage. Do not yield to evil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attack, attack, more boldly even than fortune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems to permit. An offering of safety,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Incredible!&mdash;will come from a Greek city.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So, through the amplifiers of her cavern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hollow vaults, the Sibyl cast her warnings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Riddles confused with truth; and Apollo rode her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reining her rage, and shaking her, and spurring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fierceness of her heart. The frenzy dwindled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little, and her lips were still. Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began:&mdash;“For me, no form of trouble, maiden,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That I may go to my belovèd father,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Once, on these shoulders, through a thousand weapons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And following fire, and foemen. He shared with me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The road, the sea, the menaces of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Things that an old man should not bear; he bore them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tired as he was. And he it was who told me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To come to you in humbleness. I beg you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pity the son, the father. You have power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great priestess, over all; it is not for nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hecate gave you this dominion over<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Along this path,&mdash;why should I mention Theseus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why mention Hercules? I, too, descended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the line of Jupiter.” He clasped the altar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making his prayer, and she made answer to him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Son of Anchises, born of godly lineage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By night, by day, the portals of dark Dis<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To trace the footsteps back to the air above,<br /></span>

<span class="i15">Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sadness in his eyes, and downcast heart,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And they found him on dry sand; it was Misenus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeolus’ son, none better with the trumpet<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Great Hector’s man-at-arms; he was good in battle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spear as well as horn, and after Hector<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had fallen to Achilles, he had followed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas, entering no meaner service.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some foolishness came over him; he made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ocean echo to the blare of his trumpet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day, and challenged the sea-gods to a contest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In martial music, and Triton, jealous, caught him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However unbelievable the story,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And held him down between the rocks, and drowned him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the foaming waves. His comrades mourned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas most of all, and in their sorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They carry out, in haste, the Sibyl’s orders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">{150}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">They go to an old wood, and the pine-trees fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where wild beasts have their dens, and holm-oak rings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the stroke of the axe, and oak and ash are riven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the splitting wedge, and rowan-trees come rolling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the steep mountain-side. Aeneas helps them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cheers them on; studies the endless forest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Takes thought, and prays: “If only we might see it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That golden bough, here in the depth of the forest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright on some tree. She told the truth, our priestess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too much, too bitter truth, about Misenus.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sooner had he spoken than twin doves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came flying down before him, and alighted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the green ground. He knew his mother’s birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made his prayer, rejoicing,&mdash;“Oh, be leaders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherever the way, and guide me to the grove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the rich bough makes rich the shaded ground.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Aeneas paused, in thoughtful mood, with pity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over their lot’s unevenness; and saw there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wanting the honor given the dead, and grieving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leucaspis, and Orontes, the Lycian captain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had sailed from Troy across the stormy waters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drowned off Africa, with crew and vessel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was Palinurus, once his pilot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, not so long ago, had been swept over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching the stars on the journey north from Carthage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The murk was thick; Aeneas hardly knew him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrowful in that darkness, but made question:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What god, O Palinurus, took you from us?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who drowned you in the deep? Tell me. Apollo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never before was false, and yet he told me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would be safe across the seas, and come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unharmed to Italy; what kind of promise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was this, to fool me with?” But Palinurus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave him assurance:&mdash;“It was no god who drowned me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No falsehood on Apollo’s part, my captain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as I clung to the tiller, holding fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep the course, as I should do, I felt it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrenched from the ship, and I fell with it, headlong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By those rough seas I swear, I had less fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On my account than for the ship, with rudder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And helmsman overboard, to drift at the mercy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rising seas. Three nights I rode the waters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_156" id="page_156">{156}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three nights of storm, and from the crest of a wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the fourth morning, sighted Italy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was swimming to land, I had almost reached it, heavy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In soaking garments; my cramped fingers struggled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To grasp the top of the rock, when barbarous people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ignorant men, mistaking me for booty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck me with swords; waves hold me now, or winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roll me along the shore. By the light of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lovely air, I beg you, by your father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your hope of young Iulus, bring me rescue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of these evils, my unconquered leader!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast over my body earth&mdash;you have the power&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Return to Velia’s harbor,&mdash;or there may be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some other way&mdash;your mother is a goddess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Else how would you be crossing this great river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Stygian swamp?&mdash;help a poor fellow, take me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the water with you, give a dead man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least a place to rest in.” But the Sibyl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke in upon him sternly:&mdash;“Palinurus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence comes this mad desire? No man, unburied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May see the Stygian waters, or Cocytus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Furies’ dreadful river; no man may come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unbidden to this bank. Give up the hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fate is changed by praying, but hear this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little comfort in your harsh misfortune:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those neighboring people will make expiation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven by signs from heaven, through their cities<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through their countryside; they will build a tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereto bring offerings yearly, and the place<br /></span>

<span class="i15">And they went on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearing the river, and from the stream the boatman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld them cross the silent forest, nearer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turning their footsteps toward the bank. He challenged:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Whoever you are, O man in armor, coming<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Be undisturbed: the hell-hound in his cavern<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whose cruel punishment was this? Whose license<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abused you so? I heard, it seems, a story<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that last night, how you had fallen, weary<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With killing Greeks at last; I built a tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although no body lay there, in your honor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times I cried, aloud, over your spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where now your name and arms keep guard. I could not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving my country, find my friend, to give him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proper interment in the earth he came from.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Priam’s son replied:&mdash;“Nothing, dear comrade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was left undone; the dead man’s shade was given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All ceremony due. It was my own fortune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a Spartan woman’s deadliness that sunk me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under these evils; she it was who left me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These souvenirs. You know how falsely happy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We were on that last night; I need not tell you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When that dread horse came leaping over our walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pregnant with soldiery, she led the dancing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A solemn rite, she called it, with Trojan women<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Screaming their bacchanals; she raised the torches<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162">{162}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on the citadel; she called the Greeks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then&mdash;I was worn with trouble, drugged in slumber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resting in our ill-omened bridal chamber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sleep as deep and sweet as death upon me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she, that paragon of helpmates, deftly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved all the weapons from the house; my sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even, she stole from underneath my pillow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opened the door, and called in Menelaus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoping, no doubt, to please her loving husband,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win forgetfulness of her old sinning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is quickly told: they broke into the chamber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The two of them, and with them, as accomplice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses came, the crime-contriving bastard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O gods, pay back the Greeks; grant the petition<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If goodness asks for vengeance! But you, Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A living man&mdash;what chance has brought you here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vagrant of ocean, god-inspired,&mdash;which are you?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">While they were talking, Aurora’s rosy car<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had halfway crossed the heaven; all their time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might have been spent in converse, but the Sibyl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurried them forward:&mdash;“Night comes on, Aeneas;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We waste the hours with tears. We are at the cross-road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now; here we turn to the right, where the pathway leads<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wide walls beneath a cliff, a triple rampart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A river running fire, Phlegethon’s torrent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rocks roaring in its course, a gate, tremendous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pillars of adamant, a tower of iron,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too strong for men, too strong for even gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To batter down in warfare, and behind them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Fury, sentinel in bloody garments,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always on watch, by day, by night. He heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sobbing and groaning there, the crack of the lash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clank of iron, the sound of dragging shackles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noise was terrible; Aeneas halted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asking, “What forms of crime are these, O maiden?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What harrying punishment, what horrible outcry?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She answered:&mdash;“O great leader of the Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have never crossed that threshold of the wicked;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The monarch here, merciless Rhadamanthus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Punishes guilt, and hears confession; he forces<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No matter how cleverly he hides his evil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No matter how much he smiles at his own slyness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can fend atonement off; the hour of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begins his sentence. Tisiphone, the Fury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164">{164}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaps at the guilty with her scourge; her serpents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are whips of menace as she calls her sisters.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imagine the gates, on jarring hinge, rasp open,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would see her in the doorway, a shape, a sentry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Savage, implacable. Beyond, still fiercer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monstrous Hydra dwells; her fifty throats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are black, and open wide, and Tartarus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is black, and open wide, and it goes down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To darkness, sheer deep down, and twice the distance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That earth is from Olympus. At the bottom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Titans crawl, Earth’s oldest breed, hurled under<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By thunderbolts; here lie the giant twins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloeus’ sons, who laid their hands on heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tried to pull down Jove; Salmoneus here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Atones for high presumption,&mdash;it was he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who aped Jove’s noise and fire, wheeling his horses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triumphant through his city in Elis, cheering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shaking the torch, and claiming divine homage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The arrogant fool, to think his brass was lightning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His horny-footed horses beat out thunder!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jove showed him what real thunder was, what lightning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke from immortal cloud, what whirlwind fury<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came sweeping from the heaven to overtake him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Tityos, Earth’s giant son, lies sprawling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over nine acres, with a monstrous vulture<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gnawing, with crooked beak, vitals and liver<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That grow as they are eaten; eternal anguish,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Why name them all, Pirithous, the Lapiths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ixion? The roll of crime would take forever.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whoever, in his lifetime, hated his brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or struck his father down; whoever cheated<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A client, or was miserly&mdash;how many<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To treasonable war, or broke a promise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made to his lord, whoever perished, slain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over adultery, all these, walled in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wait here their punishment. Seek not to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too much about their doom. The stone is rolled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wheel keeps turning; Theseus forever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sits in dejection; Phlegyas, accursed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cries through the halls forever: <i>Being warned,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Learn justice; reverence the gods!</i> The man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sold his country is here in hell; the man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who altered laws for money; and a father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knew his daughter’s bed. All of them dared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more than dared, achieved, unspeakable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambitions. If I had a hundred tongues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred iron throats, I could not tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fullness of their crime and punishment.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then she added:&mdash;“Come: resume the journey,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I see the walls the Cyclops made, the portals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the archway, where, the orders tell us,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">They came to happy places, the joyful dwelling,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here ampler air invests the fields with light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose-colored, with familiar stars and sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some grapple on the grassy wrestling-ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In exercise and sport, and some are dancing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And others singing; in his trailing robe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Orpheus strums the lyre; the seven clear notes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accompany the dance, the song. And heroes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are there, great-souled, born in the happier years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ilus, Assaracus; the city’s founder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prince Dardanus. Far off, Aeneas wonders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing the phantom arms, the chariots,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spears fixed in the ground, the chargers browsing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unharnessed, over the plain. Whatever, living,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men delighted in, whatever pleasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was theirs in horse and chariot, still holds them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here under the world. To right and left, they banquet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the green meadows, and a joyful chorus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rises through groves of laurel, whence the river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs to the upper world. The band of heroes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwell here, all those whose mortal wounds were suffered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fighting for the fatherland; and poets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good, the pure, the worthy of Apollo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who discovered truth and made life nobler;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who served others&mdash;all, with snowy fillets<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167">{167}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Binding their temples, throng the lovely valley.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these the Sibyl questioned, most of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Musaeus, for he towered above the center<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that great throng:&mdash;“O happy souls, O poet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where does Anchises dwell? For him we come here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him we have traversed Erebus’ great rivers.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he replied:&mdash;“It is all our home, the shady<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Groves, and the streaming meadows, and the softness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the river-banks. No fixed abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is ours at all; but if it is your pleasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cross over the ridge with me; I will guide you there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By easy going.” And so Musaeus led them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the summit showed them fields, all shining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they went on over and down.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Deep in a valley of green, father Anchises<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was watching, with deep earnestness, the spirits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose destiny was light, and counting them over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All of his race to come, his dear descendants,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fates and fortunes and their works and ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he saw Aeneas coming toward him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the meadow, his hands reached out with yearning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was moved to tears, and called:&mdash;“At last, my son,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have you really come, at last? and the long road nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a son who loves his father? Do I, truly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See you, and hear your voice? I was thinking so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was hoping so, I was counting off the days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I was right about it. O my son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a long journey, over land and water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yours must have been! What buffeting of danger!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Your sorrowful shade, so often met, that led me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find these portals. The ships ride safe at anchor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe in the Tuscan sea. Embrace me, father;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let hand join hand in love; do not forsake me.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he spoke, the tears streamed down. Three times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He reached out toward him, and three times the image<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled like the breath of the wind or a dream on wings.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He saw, in a far valley, a separate grove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the woods stir and rustle, and a river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lethe, gliding past the peaceful places,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tribes of people thronging, hovering over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Innumerable as the bees in summer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Working the bright-hued flowers, and the shining<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the white lilies, murmuring and humming.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas, filled with wonder, asks the reason<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what he does not know, who are the people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such a host, and to what river coming?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anchises answers:&mdash;“These are spirits, ready<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more for life; they drink of Lethe’s water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soothing potion of forgetfulness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have longed, for long, to show them to you, name them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our children’s children; Italy discovered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So much the greater happiness, my son.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“But, O my father, is it thinkable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That souls would leave this blessedness, be willing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A second time to bear the sluggish body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trade Paradise for earth? Alas, poor wretches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why such a mad desire for light?” Anchises<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives detailed answer: “First, my son, a spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169" id="page_169">{169}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sustains all matter, heaven and earth and ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon, the stars; mind quickens mass, and moves it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence comes the race of man, of beast, of wingèd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creatures of air, of the strange shapes which ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bears down below his mottled marble surface.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these are blessed with energy from heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seed of life is a spark of fire, but the body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A clod of earth, a clog, a mortal burden.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence humans fear, desire, grieve, and are joyful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even when life is over, all the evil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ingrained so long, the adulterated mixture,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plagues and pestilences of the body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remain, persist. So there must be a cleansing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By penalty, by punishment, by fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By sweep of wind, by water’s absolution,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the guilt is gone. Each of us suffers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own peculiar ghost. But the day comes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we are sent through wide Elysium,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fields of the Blessed, a few of us, to linger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the turn of time, the wheel of ages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wears off the taint, and leaves the core of spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure sense, pure flame. A thousand years pass over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the god calls the countless host to Lethe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where memory is annulled, and souls are willing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more to enter into mortal bodies.”<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">King Latinus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was an old man, long ruler over a country<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed with the calm of peace. He was, they tell us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son of Faunus; Marica was his mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nymph, Laurentian-born. And Faunus’ father<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179">{179}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Latinus had no sons; they had been taken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By fate, in their young manhood; an only daughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Survived to keep the house alive, a girl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ripe for a husband. She had many suitors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Latium, from Ausonia. Most handsome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most blessed in ancestry, was the prince Turnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom the queen mother favored, but the portents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the high gods opposed. There was a laurel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the palace courtyard, tended through the years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sacred reverence, which king Latinus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first he built the city, had discovered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hallowed to Apollo, and the people<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On the same course to the same destination,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We see him lord it over the height of the city.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A boy’s joke, nothing more. But the spoken word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meant something more, and deeper, to Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An end of hardship. He caught up the saying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt the god’s presence. “Hail!” he cried, remembering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hail, O my destined land! All hail, ye faithful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gods of our homeland! Here our country lies.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A place once called Ardea, and it keeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its ancient name; its glory has departed.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Save them from dangers, see what thanks they give you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay low the Tuscan ranks, hold over the Latins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shield of peace. I tell you, Juno told me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To see the young men armed, and get them going<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the gates! There are ships to burn, and captains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To set on fire: the mighty gods command it.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With Turnus in arms, unless he keeps his promise.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Turnus, smiling at her, answered:&mdash;“Mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You tell me nothing new; I know a fleet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has come to Tiber’s waters; do not scare me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fears imagined; Juno, I am certain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has not forgotten me. Your age, old woman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worn-down, truth-weary, harries you with worries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes you ridiculous, a busybody,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nervous for nothing in the wars of kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to the temple, mind your proper business,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave war and peace where they belong, with warriors.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Allecto blazed with anger: Turnus, speaking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was suddenly afraid, so wild her features,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fierce her flaming eyes, the snakes of the Fury<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hissing disaster. She shoves him back; he falters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tries to say more; she plies her whip, she doubles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rising serpents, and her wild mouth cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“See me for what I am, worn down, truth-weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nervous for nothing in the wars of kings!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See what I am, see where I come from, bringing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War, war and death, from the Grim Sisters’ home.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She flung the firebrand at him, torch and terror<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smoking with lurid light. The body, sweating,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is torn from sleep; he cries for arms, he seeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arms at his bedside, through the hallways, lusting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sword and steel, war’s wicked frenzy mounting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rampant rage. Even so a cauldron bubbles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fire burns hot beneath, and water seethes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stirs, shifts, breaks out in boiling, and the cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of steam goes toward the sky. The peace is broken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194" id="page_194">{194}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The call to arms is given; let the captains<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Protect the fatherland. Turnus is coming;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No matter who they are, Trojans or Latins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turnus will take them on. And his example,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His frenzied prayer, shook his Rutulian comrades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All eagerness for war. They all admired him,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A handsome animal, with mighty antlers,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That pierced the belly and side, so the poor creature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came wounded to the house he knew, and moaning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crept into his stall, bleeding, and like a person<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asking for help, filled all the house with sorrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First Silvia came, beating her arms, and others,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Summoned for help, equipped themselves for vengeance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Allecto lurking in the silent forest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A knotted club, a sharpened stake, a firebrand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever comes to hand will serve, when anger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is looking for a weapon. Tyrrhus calls them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are warriors now, not farmers; they leave the logging,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The quartered oak, the wedges; in breathless anger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tyrrhus grabs up the axe. A perfect moment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the goddess on her watch-tower!&mdash;she comes flying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the stable roof; she sounds the shepherds’ call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straining her hellish voice on the curved horn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till grove and woodland echo. Diana’s lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hears, and Velinus’ fountain, and white Nar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spring of sulphur; and mothers, in their panic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold their young children close. But swift to the sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dire alarum, came the farmers, running;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They call no man their master; they snatch up weapons.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the other side the youth of the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour through the open gates to help Iulus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are drawn up now; no more a rustic quarrel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With stakes and clubs, the double-bladed steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decides the issue, swords are drawn, the harvest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is black and spiky; bronze defies the sunlight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tossing its luster cloudward. As waves at sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_196" id="page_196">{196}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first are little whitecaps under the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slowly turn to billows, and then great combers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rose the swell of war. Young Almo fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eldest of Tyrrhus’ sons; a whirring arrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Piercing the throat, choked him in his own blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many around him fell, among them one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A good old man, Galaesus, who had come forward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To plead for peace, and died; he was most just<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all Ausonia’s men, and wealthy, counting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five flocks of sheep and cattle; a hundred ploughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furrowed his acres.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">So they fought together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And neither won,&mdash;Allecto had kept her promise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had soaked the war in blood, she had made beginning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of death in battle. She left the western land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She soared to Juno in heaven, proud of her triumph:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“There it is for you, perfect, war created<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From disagreement! Tell them to join in friendship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let them make treaties, now my hand has spattered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans with Ausonian blood! And still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can do more, if you desire it: cities<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near-by, I can plague to war with rumors, burn them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wild desire for battle, bring in allies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From everywhere; I will sow the land with armies.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Juno answered:&mdash;“That is plenty, thank you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They can not stop it now; man battles man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh blood is on the arms that chance first gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now let them stage that bridal feast, that wedding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Venus’ distinguished son, and king Latinus!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Olympus’ ruler would be most unwilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197">{197}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let you roam thus freely in the heavens;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be gone from here; whatever more is needed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will attend to.” So spoke Saturn’s daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the serpents hissed as the Fury raised her wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flew up, swooped down, to Hell. Under high hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Italy’s heart, there lies a vale, Ampsanctus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well known in many lands. Dark forests hide it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On every side, and in its very centre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A roaring torrent over the rocks goes brawling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is a cavern here, a breathing hole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For terrible Dis, and a gorge, where Acheron river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opens the deadly jaws; and here Allecto<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sank out of sight, relieving earth and heaven.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And Juno gave the war the final touches.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherds came to the city from the battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing young Almo, slain, and old Galaesus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His peaceful face defiled; they cry to the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They call on King Latinus. Turnus is there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they cry murder, fuel to their fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making their terror double: <i>the kingdom falls</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To the men of Troy</i>, he shouts; <i>our blood is tainted;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I am degraded here!</i> And the Latin mothers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trooping the pathless woods in Bacchic orgies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amata’s cause being their cause, assemble<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every side; it is Mars for whom they clamor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not Bacchus any more. And all the people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the omens, against the will of the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cry out for wicked war. They fight each other,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almost, to siege and storm Latinus’ palace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is a rock in the sea; he stands like a sea-rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">{198}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a crash of water comes, and it is steadfast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the howl of the waves, and the roar is useless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sea-weed, flung at the side, goes dripping back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But even so Latinus could not conquer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their blind determination. Things were going<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Juno willed. He invoked the empty air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He invoked the gods, in vain. “Alas, we are broken!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are broken by fate, we are swept away by storm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will pay for this, you will pay for it with bloodshed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O my poor people! And punishment is waiting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turnus, for you; you will find it very bitter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then you will pray, and it will be too late.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My rest is won, my voyage almost over;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lose a happy death.” He said no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut himself in his palace, and relinquished<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reins of power.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">There was a Latin custom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cherished, thereafter, by the Alban cities,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As now by Rome, great empress&mdash;when they rouse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The god of war to battle, against the Getans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arabians, Hyrcanians, no matter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether they march on India, or strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win back captured standards from the Parthians,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The custom holds. There are twin gates of Mars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held in both awe and reverence; they are fastened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By bolts of bronze, a hundred, by the eternal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Solidity of iron, and their guardian<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Janus, always watchful at the threshold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, when the fathers vote for war, the consul,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Must swing the portals wide, with his own voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cry war, and the others follow, and the trumpets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give tongue in bronze agreement. So Latinus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was called on, by that custom, for announcement<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of war against the Trojans, for the opening<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those grim gates. But he refused to touch them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled from the task he loathed, hid in the darkness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Juno, coming from heaven, shoved them open<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her own hand; the turning hinges grated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The iron was loosed for war. And all Ausonia,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listless till then, unmoved, blazed out in fury:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On foot they came, on horseback; through the dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cry rang out <i>To arms!</i> They oil the shields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They make the javelins shine, they hone the axes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They love the sight of banner, the sound of trumpet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In five great cities, Tibur, Crustumerium,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antemnae, and Atina, and Ardea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong towns, and proud, and turret-crowned, they forge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New weapons on their anvils; they carve out helmets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make wicker covers for the shields; they hammer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breastplates of bronze, or greaves of pliant silver.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They beat their ploughshares into swords; the furnace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives a new temper to the blades of their fathers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alarum sounds, password is whispered. Helmets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come down from the wall; the yoke weighs down the horses;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A woman whose hands were never trained to weaving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the use of wool, to basketry, a girl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As tough in war as any, in speed afoot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swifter than wind. She could go flying over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tips of the ears of the wheat, and never bruise them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So light her way, she could run on the lift of the wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dry-shod; and they came from the houses and fields to wonder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gaze at her going, young men, and matrons thronging,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide-eyed and with parted lips, at the glory of royal crimson<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over her shoulders’ smoothness, the clasp of the gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her hair, and the way she carried the Lycian quiver,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heft of the pastoral myrtle, the wand with the spearpoint.<br /></span>

<big>AENEAS<br /> AT THE SITE OF ROME</big></h2>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">As Turnus raised war’s banner, and the trumpets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blared loud above Laurentum’s citadel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fiery horses reared, and arms were clashing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confusion reigned: all Latium joined alliance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth were mad for war. Messapus, Ufens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that despiser of the gods, Mezentius,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought forces in from everywhere; wide fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were stripped of countrymen. They sent a message<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Venulus, to Diomede in Arpi:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Come to our aid; the Trojans are in Latium;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Aeneas with a fleet and vanquished gods</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Proclaims himself a king; it is fate, he says;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And many tribes are joining him; his name</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Spreads far and wide in Latium.</i> Diomede<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The message says) better than many others,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should know the outcome, if the grace of fortune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follows Aeneas in the scheme he nurtures.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knows the Trojans; he can judge them better<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than Turnus or Latinus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_208" id="page_208">{208}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i8">So, in Latium,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Events were shaping, and Aeneas knew it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw it all, and turned and tossed in torment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a great sea of trouble. The swift mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went searching, probing, veering with every shift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when in a bronze bowl the light of water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reflected by the sun or moonlight, wavers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dances and flits about, from wall to ceiling.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night: over all the world the weary creatures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beasts and birds, were deep in sleep; Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With warfare in his heart, stretched out for rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the cold sky was awning over the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sleep came late. Before him rose an image,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An aged head amid the poplar leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mantle of gray, and shady reeds around him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tiber, the river-god, in consolation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And comfort speaking:&mdash;“Son of the gods, redeemer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Troy from overseas, her savior ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O long-awaited on Laurentian fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here is your home, be sure of it; here dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your household gods, be sure. Do not turn back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not be frightened by the threats of war:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swollen rage of Heaven has subsided.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon&mdash;do not take my words for idle phantoms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Illusions of a dream&mdash;under the holm-oaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the shore, you will find a huge sow lying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White, with a new-born litter at her udders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thirty of them, all white, a certain token<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a new city, in thirty years. Your son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will found it; he will call it the White City,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_209" id="page_209">{209}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glorious name, beyond all doubt whatever.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Further, I have a word or two of guidance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speed you through the pressure of the moment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward ultimate victory. Inland a little<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arcadian people live, a race descended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Pallas’ line; their king is called Evander,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under whose banner they have built a city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on the hills; its name is Pallanteum.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wage continual warfare with the Latins;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take them as allies, in covenant and treaty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I myself will guide you there, upstream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the banks, the oars against the current.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise, goddess-born; when the stars set, make prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Juno first, with suppliant vows appeasing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her threats and anger. As for me, my tribute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May wait your triumph. I am blue-green Tiber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The river most dear to Heaven, I am the river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see, brim-full to these rich banks, this ploughland:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is my home, the source of lofty cities.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So spoke the river-god, to his deep pool diving.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slumber and night were gone. Aeneas rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faced eastern sunlight, took up river water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the hollow of his hands, and made his prayer:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Laurentian Nymphs, to whom the rivers owe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their essence, father Tiber, holy river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive Aeneas, be his shield in danger.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherever your presence dwells, in pool or fountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever land its flowing bounty graces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O comforter in time of trouble, surely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our gifts will bring their meed of honor, always,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_210" id="page_210">{210}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the horned ruler of the western waters.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only be with us, give us confirmation!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had made his prayer; two ships were quickly chosen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the fleet, equipped, and the crews made ready.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And then a marvel struck their eyes, a wonder!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White in the wood, on the green ground, there lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sow with her white litter, and Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought them in sacrifice to Juno’s altar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that long night, the Tiber calmed his flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silent wave, retreating, lay as still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As pool or mere or watery plain; the oars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dipped without strain; the voyage went with laughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cheerful shouting; over the waters rode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oily keels; and waves and woods in wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld the shields of men, the colored vessels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divide the flood. Day turns to night. They traverse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winding bends, with green shade arching over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parting the green woods in the quiet water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till it is noon, and they see walls and houses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Evander’s town, which Roman power later<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made equal to the city, a mighty empire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it was little then. They turned to the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew near the city.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">On that day, it happened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king was paying customary homage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a grove before the city, to the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Hercules, most of all. And his son Pallas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was with him there, and the leaders of the people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lowly senate, bringing gifts of incense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the warm blood was smoking at the altars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_211" id="page_211">{211}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They saw the tall ships come, they saw them gliding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upstream, through the dark wood, the feathered oar-blades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making no noise at all, and they were frightened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rose; they would have left the feast, but Pallas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unterrified, forbade them; he seized a weapon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushed out in challenge, calling from a hillock:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What cause, young men, has brought you here, exploring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ways that you do not know? Where are you going?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is your race? Where do you come from? Are you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bringers of peace or war?” Aeneas answered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the high stern, raising the branch of olive:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“We are men from Troy; we are armed against the Latins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose arrogant war we flee. We seek Evander.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take him this message: tell him chosen leaders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dardanus’ sons, have come, to seek for friendship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For allied arms.” And Pallas, in amazement<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At hearing that great name, cried, “Come and join us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whoever you are, speak to my father, enter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O guest, into our household!” And his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reached out to greet and guide them. They left the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew near the grove; with friendly words Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke to Evander:&mdash;“Best of the sons of Greeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom, at fortune’s will, I bring petition,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing the branch of peace, I have not been frightened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To come to you, a Danaan chief, related<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Atreus’ twin sons. In my own right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am worth something; we are bound together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the god’s holy oracles, by the old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ancestral kinship, by your own renown<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212">{212}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Widespread through all the world. I am glad to follow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The will of fate. Dardanus, our great father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was father of Troy; his mother was Electra,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter of Atlas, who carries on his shoulders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weight of heaven. Mercury is your father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born, on Cyllene’s chilly peak, to Maia,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Maia, if legend is credible, the daughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Atlas, who carries heaven on his shoulders.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A common blood runs in our veins, and therefore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sent no embassies, I planned no careful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tentative overtures; myself, I came here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My life at your disposal, in supplication<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before your threshold. We are harried in war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the same race that harries you, the sons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Daunus; nothing, so they think, will stop them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we are beaten, from complete dominion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the western land and both her oceans.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive and give alliance: our hearts are brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our spirit tried and willing.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">He had finished.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Evander had been watching him, expression,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gesture, and mood, and bearing. He made answer:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“How gladly, bravest man of all the Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I recognize and welcome you! Your father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great Anchises, speaks to me again,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are the words, the voice, the very features<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I recall so well. Once Priam came here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faring to Salamis, his sister’s kingdom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was a young man then; I stared in wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the chiefs of Troy, at Priam, but Anchises<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_213" id="page_213">{213}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towered above them all, and my heart was burning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To clasp his hand, to speak with him: I met him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I led him, proudly, to Pheneus’ city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he left, he gave me a fine quiver<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Lycian arrows, a cloak with gold embroidered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pair of golden bridles; my son Pallas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoices in them now. The bond you ask for<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is given, the treaty made. To-morrow morning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My escort will attend your leave, my riches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be at your service. Meanwhile, since you come here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As friends of ours, join us in celebrating<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These yearly rites of ours. It is not permitted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our people to postpone them. In your kindness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Become accustomed to your allies’ tables.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He gave the orders for the feast’s renewal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more the cups are set; the king, in person,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conducts his guests to places on the greensward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reserving for Aeneas, in special honor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A maple throne, draped with the skin of a lion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chosen attendants and the priest of the altar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring the roast portions, pile the bread in baskets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serve Bacchus’ wine. Aeneas and the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feast on the consecrated food.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">When hunger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was satisfied, and the wine went round, Evander<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told them a story:&mdash;“No vain superstition,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No ignorance of the gods, enjoins upon us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These solemn rites, this feast, this deep devotion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a mighty power’s altar. O Trojan guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are grateful men, saved from a cruel danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_214" id="page_214">{214}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We pay these rites each year, each year renewing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A worship justly due. Look up at the cliff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung on the high rocks yonder, see the scattered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rubble of rock, the ruin of a dwelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jumble of toppled crags. There was a cave there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once on a time; no man had ever measured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its awful depth, no sunlight ever cheered it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The half-man, Cacus, terrible to look at,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lived in that cave, and the ground was always reeking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the smell of blood, and nailed to the doors, the faces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of men hung pale and wasted. Vulcan fathered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This monster; you would know it if you saw him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the black fire pouring from mouth and nostrils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bulk of moving evil. But time at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought us the help we prayed for; a great avenger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A god, came to our rescue, Hercules,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud in the death and spoil of triple Geryon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drove his huge bulls this way, the great herd filling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valley and river. And the crazy Cacus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who never would lose a chance for crime or cunning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made off with four of the bulls and four sleek heifers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dragging them by their tails; the tracks would never<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prove he had driven them to his rocky cavern.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hid them in the darkness; whoever looked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would think they had gone not to, but from, the cave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile, as Hercules drove the well-fed herd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the stables to the road again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of them lowed in protest; hill and grove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave back the sound, and from the cave one heifer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lowed in return. That was the doom of Cacus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">{215}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black bile burned hot in Hercules; he grabbed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His weapons, his great knotted club, went rushing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the mountain-top. Never before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had men seen terror in the eyes of Cacus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swifter than wind, he dove into his cavern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut himself in, shattered the links of iron<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That held aloft the giant boulder, dropped it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To block the doorway, and Hercules came flinging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His angry strength against it, to no purpose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This way he faced, and that, and gnashed his teeth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sheer frustration; he went around the mountain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times, in burning rage; three times he battered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bulkhead of the door; three times he rested,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathless and weary, on the floor of the valley.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the cavern ridge, a pointed rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All flint, cut sharp, with a sheer drop all around it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose steep, a nesting place for kites and buzzards.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It leaned a little leftward toward the river.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Hercules grabbed and shook, straining against it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His right hand pushed and wrenched it loose; he shoved it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a sudden heave, down hill, and the heaven thundered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The river ran backward and the banks jumped sideways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cacus’ den stood open, that great palace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the rock, the chambered vault of shadows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An earthquake, so, might bring to light the kingdoms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the world below the world, the pallid regions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loathed by the gods, the gulf of gloom, where phantoms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shiver and quake as light descends upon them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So there was Cacus, desperate in the light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216" id="page_216">{216}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught in the hollow rock, howling and roaring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Hercules rained weapons down upon him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Everything he could use, from boughs to millstones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Cacus still had one way out of the danger:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cloud of smoke rolled out of his jaws; the cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkened to utter blackness, thick night rolling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fitful glints of fire. This was too much<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Hercules in his fury; he jumped down through it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through fire, where the smoke came rolling forth the thickest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the black billows seethed around the cavern.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cacus, in the darkness, to no purpose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured forth his fire and smoke. Hercules grabbed him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twisted him into a knot, hung on and choked him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the eyes bulged out and the throat was dry of blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tore the doors loose, and the house was open;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">People could see the lost and stolen plunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hercules dragged the shapeless ugly carcass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out by the feet, a fascinating object<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the gaze of men, the terrible eyes, the muzzle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hairy chest, and the fire dead in the gullet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever since then we keep this day, rejoicing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In honor of our deliverance; Potitius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was founder of the rite, Pinaria’s household<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Custodian of the service. In this grove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We set our altar, calling it the greatest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And greatest it shall be, to me, forever.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Join with us, then, in honor of all that glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bind wreaths around your temples, reach the wine-cup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call with good-will upon our common god.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_217" id="page_217">{217}</a></span>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He veiled his hair with the two-colored poplar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Hercules’ honor, and held out the goblet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All made libation and prayer.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And evening came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the priests went forth, Potitius first; they wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The skins of beasts, and they were bearing torches.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feast renewed, they brought the welcome viands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a second table, loading, too, the altars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Dancing Priests around the sacred altars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lit fire and sang their songs. They too wore poplar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both groups, one old, one young, and chanted verses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In praise of Hercules, his deeds, his glories,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How first he strangled in his grip twin serpents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monsters Juno sent; how, great in war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy and Oechalia went down before him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How, under King Eurystheus, he bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand heavy toils, at Juno’s order.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hail, O unvanquished hero, whose hand brought low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pholus, Hylaeus, the cloud-born double shapes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monsters of Crete and the Nemean lion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Stygian lakes trembled at Hercules’ crossing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cerberus was frightened, in his cavern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lying on bones half-eaten. O unafraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of any monster, even Typhoeus, towering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High in his arms, even the snake of Lerna<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all its hissing heads,&mdash;hail, son of Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hail, glorious addition to the heavens!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Favor our rites and yours with gracious blessing!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they sang praises, and they crowned the service<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the tale of Cacus, that fire-breathing monster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_218" id="page_218">{218}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hill and woodland echoed to the singing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then back to the city again; and old Evander<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept his son Pallas near him and Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talking of various matters, so the journey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was lightened, and the landscape charmed Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who wondered as he watched the scene, and questioned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And learned its early legend. King Evander<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began the story:&mdash;“Native Nymphs and Fauns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwelt in these woodlands once, and a race of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprung from the trunks of trees, or rugged oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men primitive and rude, with little culture:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had no knowledge of ploughing, none of harvest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fruits of the wild trees, the spoils of hunting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave them their nourishment. Then Saturn came here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fleeing Jove’s arms, an exile from his kingdom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He organized this race, unruly, scattered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the high mountains, gave them law and order.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave the place a name; Latium, he called it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since once he lay there safely, hiding in shelter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under his rule there came those golden ages<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That people tell of, all the nations dwelling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In amity and peace. But little by little<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A worse age came, lack-luster in its color,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the madness of war, and the evil greed of having.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the Ausonian bands, Sicanian peoples,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the land of Saturn took on other names,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the kings came, and the fierce giant Thybris<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whom we named our river; we forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its older title, Albula. Here I came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An exile from my country, over the seas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219" id="page_219">{219}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven by fate and fortune, which no man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can cope with or escape. The nymph Carmentis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mother, led me here with solemn warnings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under Apollo’s guidance.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">So Evander<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finished the tale, resumed the walk. They came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, to an altar and a gate: Carmental<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Romans call it, in honor of that nymph<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who first foretold the greatness of the Romans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glory of Pallanteum. Past the portal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They came to a spreading grove, a sanctuary<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restored by Romulus, and under the cold cliff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lupercal, named, in Arcadian fashion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the great god Pan. And then Evander showed him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wood of Argiletum, and told the legend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the death of Argus, once a guest. From there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They went to the Tarpeian house, and a place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Golden as we now know it, once a thicket,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once brush and briar, and now our Capitol.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even then men trembled, fearful of a presence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haunting this wood, this rock. “A god lives here,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Evander said, “What god, we are not certain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But certainly a god. Sometimes my people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think they have seen, it may be, Jove himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clashing the darkening shield, massing the storm-cloud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here you can see two towns; the walls are shattered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they remind us still of men of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two forts, one built by Janus, one by Saturn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Janiculum, Saturnia.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">So they came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_220" id="page_220">{220}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conversing with each other, to the dwelling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where poor Evander lived, and saw the cattle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard them lowing, through the Roman forum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fashionable section of our city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as they came to the house itself, Evander<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembered something,&mdash;“Hercules,” he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Great victor that he was, bent head and shoulders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To enter here, and this house entertained him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dare, O my guest, to think of wealth as nothing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make yourself worthy of the god, and come here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without contempt for poverty.” He led him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great Aeneas, under the low rafters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found him a couch, nothing but leaves, and the bedspread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Libyan bear-skin. And night came rushing down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark-wingèd over the earth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And Venus’ heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was anxious for her son, and with good reason,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing the threats and tumult of the Latins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She spoke to Vulcan, in that golden chamber<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where they were wife and husband, and her words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were warm with love:&mdash;“When the Greek kings were tearing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy’s towers as they deserved, and the walls were fated<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fall to enemy fire, I sought no aid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For those poor people, I did not ask for weapons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made by your art and power; no, dearest husband,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would not put you to that useless labor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much as I owed to Priam’s sons, however<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sorrowed for my suffering Aeneas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, at Jove’s command, he has made a landing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_221" id="page_221">{221}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the Rutulian coast; I come, a suppliant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the great power I cherish, a mother asking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arms for her son. If Thetis and Aurora<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could move you with their tears, behold what people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unite against me, what cities sharpen weapons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind closed gates, intent on our destruction!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Venus pleaded, and as she saw him doubtful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goddess flung her snowy arms around him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fondlement, in soft embrace, and fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran through him; warmth, familiar to the marrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softened his sternness, as at times in thunder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light runs through cloud. She knew her charms, the goddess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoicing in them, conscious of her beauty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure of the power of love, and heard his answer:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“No need for far-fetched pleading, dearest goddess;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have you no faith in me? You might have asked it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those old days; I would have armed the Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Jupiter and the fates might well have given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another ten years of life to Troy and Priam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, if your purpose is for war, I promise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever careful craft I have, whatever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Command I have of iron or electrum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever fire and air can do. Your pleading<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is foolish; trust your power!” And he came to her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the embrace they longed for, and on her bosom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sank, later, into slumber.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">And rose early<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When night was little more than half way over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The way a housewife must, who tends the spindle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_222" id="page_222">{222}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising to stir and wake the drowsing embers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Working by night as well as day, and keeping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The housemaids at the task, all day, till lamplight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A faithful wife, through toil, and a good mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even so, like her, with no more self-indulgence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord of Fire rose early, from soft pillows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the labor of the forge.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">An island rises<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near the Sicanian coast and Lipare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeolian land, steep over smoking rocks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below them roars a cavern, hollow vaults<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scooped out for forges, where the Cyclops pound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the resounding anvils; lumps of steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hiss in the water, and the blasts of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pant in the furnaces; here Vulcan dwells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The place is called Vulcania, and here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord of Fire comes down. In the great cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smiths were working iron; a thunderbolt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as Jove hurls from heaven, was almost finished,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaped by the hands of Brontes, Steropes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And naked-limbed Pyracmon. They had added<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three rods of twisted rain and three of cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And three of orange fire and wingèd wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now they were working in the flash, the sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fear, the anger, the pursuing flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elsewhere a chariot for Mars was building<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To harry men and cities; and for Pallas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An awful shield, with serpent scales of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snakes interwoven, and the Gorgon’s head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awaiting polish. The neck was severed, the eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_223" id="page_223">{223}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already seemed to roll, when Vulcan came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying, “Away with this! Another task<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demands your toil, your thought. Arms for a warrior!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Use all your strength, you need it now; exert<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flying hands, ply all your master skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Break off delay!” And all, obedient, bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the great task; the bronze, the golden ore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run down like rivers, and the wounding steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melts in the furnace as they shape the shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welding it, orb on orb, a sevenfold circle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made one, for all the weapons of the Latins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some keep the bellows panting, others dip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hissing bronze in water, and the anvil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Groans under the hammer-stroke. In turn they raise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their arms in measured cadence, and the tongs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take hold of the hot metal, twist and turn it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sped the work on Lemnos.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And Evander<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was wakened by the kindly light of morning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bird-song under the eaves, and the old man rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Donned simple tunic and sandals, and hung on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His simple sword, and over his shoulders twisted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The panther hide, out of the way of the hilt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two hounds were all his bodyguard; he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, to Aeneas’ cabin; he remembered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His words and promised service, found his guest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An early riser also; hand met hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon companions joined them, young prince Pallas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loyal Achates. They stroll a while, then settle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves for conversation, and Evander<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_224" id="page_224">{224}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is first to speak:&mdash;“Great captain of the Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot, while you live, consider Troy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beaten town, I cannot see her people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As anything but victors. I am sorry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our power to help is meager. On one side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A river hems us in, and on the other<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rutulian armies thunder at our walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, I can find you, or I think so, allies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great people, an encampment rich in kingdoms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An unexpected aid. The fates have brought you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the right place. Not far away, Agylla,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A city built of ancient stone, lies waiting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A town the Lydians founded; you know the race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renowned in war. It was a prosperous city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many years, until Mezentius ruled it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cruel, arrogant man, sadist and savage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God pay him back in kind! I cannot tell you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All his foul deeds: this will suffice;&mdash;he fastened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live men to dead men, strapped their hands together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tied face to face, and killed them, slowly, slowly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the waste and stain and clasp of that long death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They suffered long, his subjects, but at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rose in arms against him, his mad household,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurled fire to his roof-top, slaughtered his companions.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fled that ruin to Rutulian fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Turnus’ weapons shielded him. Now all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Etruria, risen in arms, demands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With threat of war, the king for punishment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you shall be the leader of those thousands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who throng the shore with ships, whose cry is <i>Forward!</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_225" id="page_225">{225}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But an old prophet holds them back, those warriors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pride and glory of an ancient people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom a just grievance and a righteous anger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inflames against Mezentius. <i>It is not fated</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He says, <i>for any native-born Italian</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To tame a race so proud. Choose foreign leaders!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so the Etruscan battle-lines have settled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwarlike on the plain, through heaven’s warning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tarchon himself has sent me envoys, bearing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crown and sceptre, urging me to his camp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bidding me take the throne. But cold old age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And years too thin for battle, these begrudge me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The high command. I would send my son, but Pallas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes from a Sabine mother; he is partly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A native-born Italian. You, Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possess the proper strength, the proper lineage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The summons of the gods. Take up the burden!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Pallas will go with you, my hope and comfort.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are the one to teach him a soldier’s duty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How to endure; let him learn from you in action,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold your deeds, and, in his youth, admire them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will give two hundred horsemen, young Arcadians,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flower of our manhood; and two hundred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will go with you besides in the name of Pallas.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Aeneas and Achates, listening, brooded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With downcast gaze, in troubled speculation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prolonging bitter thoughts, but Venus gave them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sign from the bright heaven: a flash of thunder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came from the cloudless sky, a blare of trumpets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all things suddenly shaken. They looked up swiftly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_226" id="page_226">{226}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again, again, they heard the roar and rumble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They saw arms redden in the clear of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listened to thunder in cloud. And some were frightened;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so the Trojan: he knew his mother’s promise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Ask not, O friend, the meaning of the portent,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cried, “Olympus summons me; I know it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the sign my goddess-mother promised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When war was near; she would bring me arms from Vulcan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, to help us all. Alas! what slaughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waits for the Latins now! How costly, Turnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The price that must be paid me! Shields and helmets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bodies of brave men, swept under Tiber.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now let them call for battle, and break treaties!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He rose and at his quickening the altars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blazed into sudden fire; he paid his honors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Hercules, to all the gods of household,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all made sacrifice, sheep duly chosen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas sought, once more, his ships, his comrades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chose, to attend him, those most brave in battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despatched the rest down stream again with tidings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take Ascanius of his father’s fortunes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horses are brought for all the Trojan leaders,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With lion-skin caparison, claws gilded.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Double their prayers, and fear comes nearer danger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Mars’ great image looming large. Evander<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_227" id="page_227">{227}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holds Pallas by the hand, cannot release him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speaks through his tears:&mdash;“If Jupiter would only<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring me my lost years back, make me the man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I used to be, I was once, at Praeneste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I struck down the foremost ranks, and burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The piled up shields! That day I was a hero,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A conqueror, and Erulus went down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By this right hand, to hell. His mother gave him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three lives, and threefold armor; I had to kill him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times, and did, and thrice I stripped his armor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I were what I used to be, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They would never take you from me; and Mezentius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would never have heaped those insults on his neighbor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never have made a widow of the city.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you, great gods on high, and you, great king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the high gods, take pity on a father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear the Arcadian king. I pray for life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As long as Pallas lives, I pray to see him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you will spare him; if he comes back safely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pray to meet him once again. No more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ask; how hard my life may be, no matter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if there is in fortune any menace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something I cannot speak of, let me die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before I know the worst, while I can hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However I doubt, while still I have my Pallas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My late and only pleasure, here beside me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the column forms, and the echo of the gallop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes clopping back through the ground where the dust is rising.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The cold stream, Caere, has a grove beside it,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the dark firs make a shelter: the old people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rumor says, held grove and feast-day sacred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in Silvanus’ honor, god of the fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God of the fold. Tarchon and his Etruscans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were camped not far from here, and from the hill-top<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watchers could see their legions, tented safely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the wide plain. In Caere’s grove Aeneas<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By Vulcan’s promised skill. Fear not, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To face the wars with Turnus and the Latins!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the word, the embrace. She placed the armor,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The helmet with the terrible plumes and flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal sword, the breastplate, made of bronze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire-colored, huge, shining the way a cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark-blue, turns crimson under the slanting sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The greaves of gold refined and smooth electrum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spear, the final masterpiece, the shield.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Hereon the great prophetic Lord of Fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had carved the story out, the stock to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wars, each one in order, all the tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Italy and Roman triumph. Here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Mars’ green cave the she-wolf gives her udders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the twin boys, turning half round to lick them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And neither is afraid, and both are playing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another scene presents the Circus-games,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Romans took their Sabine brides, and war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke out between old Tatius and the sons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Romulus, and was ended, monarchs pledging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace at the altars over sacrifice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mettus, the false, by the wild horses drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quartered, sheds his life-blood over the brambles;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rush on the steel for freedom; Clelia breaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her bonds to swim the river; and Horatius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breaks down the bridge. The guardian Manlius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holds the high capitol and that crude palace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh with the straw of Romulus; the goose<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_230" id="page_230">{230}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flutters in silver through the colonnades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrieking alarm; the Gauls are near in darkness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Golden their hair, their clothing, and their necks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleam white in collars of gold, and each one carries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two Alpine javelins; they have long shields.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near them, the Fire-god sets the priests with caps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wool, the miracle of the shields from heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Salii dancing, the Luperci naked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the chaste matrons riding through the city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In cushioned chariots. Far off, he adds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seats of Hell, the lofty gates of Pluto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Penance for sin: Catiline, with the Furies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making him cower; farther off, the good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Cato giving laws. And all this scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound with the likeness of the swelling ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blue water and whitecap, where the dolphins playing<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Actium, the ships of bronze, Leucate burning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hot with the glow of war, and waves on fire<br /></span>

<span class="i0">High on the lofty stern; his temples flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With double fire, and over his head there dawns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father’s star. Agrippa leads a column<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With favoring wind and god, the naval garland<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wreathing his temples. Antony assembles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Egypt and all the East; Antony, victor<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Marshals the foes of Rome, himself a Roman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With&mdash;horror!&mdash;an Egyptian wife. The surge<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That islands were uprooted in their anger.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fireballs and shafts of steel are slanting showers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fields of Neptune redden with the slaughter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen drives on her warriors, unseeing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The double snakes of death; rattle and cymbals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compete with bugle and trumpet. Monstrous gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every form and fashion, one, Anubis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaped like a dog, wield their outrageous weapons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wrath at Venus, Neptune, and Minerva.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mars, all in steel, storms through the fray; the Furies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swoop from the sky; Discord exults; Bellona,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bloody scourge, comes lashing; and Apollo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Actium bends his bow. Egypt and India,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sabaeans and Arabians, flee in terror.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the contagion takes the queen, who loosens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sheets to slackness, courts the wind, in terror,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale at the menace of death. And the Nile comes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet her, a protecting god, his mantle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread wide, to bring a beaten woman home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Caesar enters Rome triumphant, bringing<br /></span>

<h2><a name="BOOK_IX" id="BOOK_IX"></a>BOOK IX<br /><br />
<big>IN THE<br /> ABSENCE OF AENEAS</big></h2>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">While all this happened far away, queen Juno<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent Iris down from heaven to bold Turnus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She found him resting in a sacred valley,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pilumnus’ grove, his ancestor; all radiant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She spoke to him:&mdash;“No god would promise, Turnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This answer to your prayers, but the turn of time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has put it in your hands. Aeneas has gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving the town, the fleet, and his companions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking the realm of Palatine Evander,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more than that: he has won some cities over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He calls the Etruscan countrymen to arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are you waiting for? Now is the time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For chariot and horse. Break off delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the bewildered camp!” She spoke, and rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skyward on even wings, and under the clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut her great soaring arc. And Turnus knew her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raised his hands to the sky, and followed her flight:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O Iris, pride of heaven, who sent you to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_234" id="page_234">{234}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through clouds to earth? Whence comes this storm of brightness?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see the heavens part, and the stars wheeling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the sky. I follow these great omens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whoever calls to arms.” And, with the word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He went to the stream, took water up, prayed often,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making his vows to all the gods of heaven.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And now, over all the plain, the army was coming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich in caparison, and rich in horses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In gold and broidered robes, Messapus leading,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Turnus in the center, and Tyrrhus’ sons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As captains in the rear: they stream as Ganges<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streams when his seven quiet tides flood over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Nile resents his deep confining channel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans see the sudden cloud, black dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thickening over the plain, and darkness rising,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Caicus cries from the rampart:&mdash;“What is this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O fellow-citizens, this rolling darkness?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring the swords quickly, bring weapons, climb the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here comes the enemy, yea! Hurry, hurry!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trojans, and noise, pour through the gates together.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men fill the walls. For so, on his departure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas had given orders: if something happened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They should not risk a battle in the open,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They should only guard the camp, protect the ramparts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, much as they would love to mix in battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anger and shame give way to prompt obedience.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bar the gates; protected by their towers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wait while the foe comes on. And Turnus, riding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impatient past his dawdling column, is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_235" id="page_235">{235}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the city knows it. He has twenty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast riders with him, his mount a piebald Thracian,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His helmet gold with crimson crest. He cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Who will be first with me? Will anybody<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be first with me against them? Let them have it!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the word, he lets the javelin fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First sign of battle; and they cheer and follow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wonder a little at the Trojans, cowards<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who dare not fight in the open, man to man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hug their walls for comfort. Round and round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turnus, a wild man, rides, seeking an entrance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there is no way in. He is like a wolf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lurking about a sheep-fold, snarling at midnight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the pens, enduring wind and rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the bleating lambs are safe beneath the ewes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he, unable to get at them, rages<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce and dry-throated in the drive of hunger;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Turnus looks at wall and camp, and passion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burns hot within him, burns to his very bones.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How to get in? or how to yank the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of their cloister, smear them over the plain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, but the fleet is there, beside the camp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sheltered by earthworks and the flowing river:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lies the chance! He calls for fire, he hurls it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The burning torch, and his hand, almost, is burning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all of them pitch in&mdash;Turnus has shown them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Turnus eggs them on&mdash;they are armed with firebrands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rob the hearths; the tar flares lurid yellow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the grey of the cloud, the soot and ashes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236">{236}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">What god, O Muses, turned the fire? Who saved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojan ships? Remind me&mdash;the story is old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men have believed it long, its glory endless.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first Aeneas built the fleet on Ida,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preparing for deep seas, the mother of gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Queen Cybele, spoke to Jove:&mdash;“Grant me, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord of Olympus now, a mother’s prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had a pine-wood on the mountain-top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men, for many years, brought offerings there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I loved that forest, dark with fir and maple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the Trojan lacked a fleet, I gave him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My timber gladly; now my heart is troubled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Relieve my fear, and let a mother’s pleading<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep them from wreck on any course, unshaken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By any whirlwind. Grown upon our mountains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They should have privilege.” Her son, the swayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the stars of the world, replied, “What call, O mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this you make on fate? What are you seeking?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should keels laid down by mortal hand have title<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To life immortal? Should Aeneas travel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through danger, unendangered? Such power is given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No god in heaven. But I make this promise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After their course is run, after the harbors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Italy receive them, safe from ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with Aeneas landed in Laurentum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will take away their mortal shape, I will make them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goddesses of the sea, like Nereus’ daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Galatea, the nymphs who breast the foam.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Jupiter promised, and, as gods do, took oath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the rivers of his brother under the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237">{237}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The banks that seethe with the black pitchy torrent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made Olympus tremble with his nod.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The promised day had come, the fates had finished<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The allotted span, when Turnus’ desecration<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warned Cybele to keep the torch and firebrand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from her holy vessels. A new light blazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mortal sight, and from the east a cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran across heaven, and choirs from Ida followed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a dread voice came down the air:&mdash;“O Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be in no hurry to defend my vessels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have no need of arms; Turnus, most surely,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will burn the seas before he burns these pine-trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go forth in freedom, goddesses of ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Mother wills it so.” And each ship parted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cable from bank, and dove to the deep water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As dolphins dive, and reappeared as maiden,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh marvel!&mdash;and all of them bore out to ocean.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Rutulian hearts were stunned, their captains shaken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their steeds confused and frightened; even Tiber<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrank back from the sea, and the murmuring stream protested.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Turnus kept his nerve, his words rang loud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In challenge to their courage:&mdash;“These are portents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make the Trojans timid; Jove has taken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their comfort from them; the ships they always fled in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run from Rutulian fire and sword; the oceans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are pathless for the Trojans now, their hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of flight all gone: half of their world is taken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the earth is in our hands, Italians, thousands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thousands of us in arms. I am not frightened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238">{238}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">However they boast of oracles from heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Venus and fate have had their share: the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have done enough even to touch our richness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Ausonian fields. I have my omens, also,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To match with theirs, a sword to slay the guilty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death for the rape of brides! Not Atreus’ sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only Menelaus and Mycenae,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know what this hurt can be, this need for vengeance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This right to take up arms. Once to have perished,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They tell us, is enough. Once to have sinned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ought to have been enough and more. Hereafter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All women should be hateful to them, cowards<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hiding behind the sheltering moat and rampart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little barriers that give them courage!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have they not seen the walls that Neptune built them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sink in the fires? Which one of you is ready,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave hearts, to slash their barriers with the sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To join me in the onrush? I do not need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The arms of Vulcan, nor a thousand vessels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the Trojans. Let them have Etruria!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One thing, at least, they need not fear,&mdash;the darkness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sneaking theft of their Palladium image,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guards slain in the dark, hiders in horse’s belly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fight in open daylight, I have fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To put around their walls, I will teach them something,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their business now is not with those Greek heroes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Hector kept at bay for ten long years.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now day is almost over; you have done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good work; rest now; be happy, be preparing,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Meanwhile, the guards were posted, under orders<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or does each man’s desire become his god?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I want much more than this, I am not contented<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all this peace and calm; my mind keeps calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_240" id="page_240">{240}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To battle, or something big. Look! The Rutulians<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are far too confident: their lights are scattered;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They lie asleep or drunk; and all is silent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listen! I have a plan. People and fathers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demand Aeneas, ask that men be sent him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With information. If I can make them promise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let you go&mdash;(the glory of the action<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is all I want myself)&mdash;I think that I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can find the way around that hill, can manage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reach the walls and fort of Pallanteum.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This shook Euryalus: a great love of praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke in his answer to his eager comrade:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What, Nisus? Are you planning to leave me out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this bold scheme, planning to go alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into such dangers? No; no, no. I am<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opheltes’ son, a warrior trained among<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greek terror and Trojan suffering; and I follow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With you, great-souled Aeneas and his fortunes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have a spirit, not too fond of living,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not too dissatisfied to buy with death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The honor that you strive for.” Nisus answered:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I had no fear on your account, be certain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That would be shameless of me: so may Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or any god that looks on this with favor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring me back home triumphant. But disaster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well you know, or god, or chance, might take me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If so, your youth being worthier, I’d have you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be my survivor, give to earth my body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rescued or ransomed, or pay the final honor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To, it might be, an empty tomb. I would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_241" id="page_241">{241}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cause sorrow to the only woman of many<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who scorned Acestes’ city, and came on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With you, her only son.” But then the other<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied:&mdash;“There is no use in all this talking.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mind is fixed, and we had better hurry.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He roused the guards; new men came on; together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Euryalus and Nisus seek their leader.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">All other creatures over all the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were easing their troubles in slumber, and hearts forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow and pain; not so the Trojan leaders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meeting in council. Here were things of moment;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What should they do? how would they reach Aeneas?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stood there, leaning on long spears, most gravely,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding their shields. Euryalus and Nisus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crave instant audience; the matter is urgent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They say, and worth a little interruption.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iulus takes the lead, meets their impatience,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tells Nisus to speak out. “Give us a hearing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O men of Troy,” says Nisus, “do not hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our years against us: we have something for you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the Rutulians are drunk or sleeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are quiet now. There is a place, we know it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have seen it with our eyes, a place that cunning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can take advantage of: you know the gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearest the sea, and how the road splits off there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The watchfires there die down, and the black smoke rises<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark to the sky out there. Give us a chance!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us go to find Aeneas and Pallanteum.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will see us here again; it will not be long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till we come back, weighed down with spoil. We will kill them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_242" id="page_242">{242}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will not miss the way; we have seen the city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far in the distant valleys. We go hunting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along here often; we know all the river.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know it all by heart.” And old Aletes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wise man in a council, gave the answer:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Gods of our ancestors, under whose guidance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy is and has been, always, our destruction<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must be far off, seeing your care has brought us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young men of such high heart and lofty spirit.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In deep emotion, his hands reached out for theirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His arms went round their shoulders. “What can I give you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young men,” he cried, “worthy your praise and glory?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best rewards come from the gods, the finest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From your own character, but good Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will not forget your service, and your peer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In age, Ascanius, surely will remember.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that young man broke in, “Most truly, Nisus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trust my fortune to you. My only safety<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies in my sire’s return. By all our gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I beg you both, I pray, bring back my father.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our trouble goes when he is here. I promise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two silver wine-cups, captured from Arisba,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pair of tripods, two great talents of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ancient bowl, the present of queen Dido.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if we capture Italy, if we live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wield the sceptre and divide the spoil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know the horse that Turnus rides, the armor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He carries on his back, all gold&mdash;that armor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shield, the crimson plumes, and the war-horse, Nisus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243">{243}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are your reward; even now, I so declare them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father will give twelve women, beautiful captives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And captive men, equipped with arms, and land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now held by king Latinus; and I cherish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all my heart, Euryalus, your courage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your years are near my own, and all my life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your glory will be mine; in peace or war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In word and deed, I trust in you, completely.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Euryalus replied:&mdash;“No day will ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prove me unworthy of brave deeds, if fortune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is kind, not cruel, to me. I ask one thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better than any gift: I have a mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Priam’s ancient line, and she came with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor soul, from Troy, and king Acestes’ city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was powerless to keep her. I leave her now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With never a word about what I am doing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever its danger is, with no farewell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot bear a mother’s tears. I beg you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comfort her helplessness, relieve her sorrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me take with me that much hope; it will help me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Face any risk more boldly.” They were weeping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this, the Trojans, all of them, Iulus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More deeply touched than any. And he spoke:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Be reassured, Euryalus; all we do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will prove as worthy as your glorious mission.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your mother shall be mine, in all but name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great honor waits the mother of a son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So great in honor. Whatever fortune follows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I vow and swear it, with an oath as solemn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As any my father ever took, I promise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_244" id="page_244">{244}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you return to us, safe and successful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your triumph and your glory and your prizes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be for her as well, for all your house.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke with tears, and from his sword-belt took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A present in farewell, the golden sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ivory scabbard, wonderfully fashioned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By old Lycaon’s talent; Mnestheus gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lion-skin to Nisus, and Aletes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exchanged his helmet with him. As they started,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the great company, young men and old ones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went with them to the gate, and out beyond it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hopeful prayers attended them. Iulus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mature beyond his years, gave many a message<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To carry to Aeneas, but the winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bore these away and swept them off to cloudland.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And now they have crossed the trench, and through night’s shadow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invade the hostile camp; they are bound to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doom of many. They see the bodies sprawling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In drunken sleep, the chariots half turned over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men lying under the wheels and among the reins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nisus whispers:&mdash;“Euryalus, we must<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be bold; the chance is given; here lies our way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watch and keep back, lest some one steal upon us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the trail behind. I lead, you follow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I have cut the way; it will be a broad one.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice was silent; and he drew the sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Rhamnes, cushioned on high covers, lying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a deep slumber, breathing deep, a king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Turnus’ favorite augur, but his doom<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_245" id="page_245">{245}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">No augury prevented. Nisus struck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three slaves, and then the armor-bearer of Remus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Remus’ charioteer&mdash;their necks were severed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With steel, and their lord Remus was beheaded.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trunk spurts blood, the earth and couch are darkened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blood, black-flowing. Lamyrus and Lamus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are slain, and young Serranus, handsome gambler<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had won high stakes that night, and slept contented<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiling at the gods’ favor, luckier surely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he had lost all night. A starving lion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loose in a sheepfold with the crazy hunger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urging him on, gnashing and dragging, raging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bloody mouth against the fearful feeble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Nisus slaughters. And his savage comrade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keeps pace with him: Fadus is slain, Herbesus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rhoetus, Abaris, all of them unconscious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murdered in sleep. One of them, Rhoetus, wakened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little, saw, and tried to hide, and crouching<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind a wine-bowl, took the sword, and rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stumbled and sprawled and belched, the red life spurting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the mouth, red wine, red blood. All hotly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Euryalus went on. Messapus’ quarters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are next in line; the fires burn low, the horses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tether-contented, graze. Then, briefly, Nisus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sensing his comrade’s recklessness in slaughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls:&mdash;“Light is near, our enemy; give over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have killed enough, we have cut the path we needed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more of this!” They left behind them armor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of solid silver, bowls, rich-woven carpets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But must take something: Rhamnes’ golden sword-belt<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_246" id="page_246">{246}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Euryalus held on to, all that armor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That went with long tradition, from father to son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From son to enemy, once more a trophy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For young Euryalus. He dons the armor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Picks up, puts on, besides, a shapely helmet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spoil of Messapus, the long plume flowing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They leave the camp, are on their way to safety.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Meanwhile, sent forward from the Latin city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horsemen were coming, while the legion rested<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind them on the plain, three hundred horsemen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With word for Turnus, under their captain Volcens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All armed with shields and riding at the ready.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are near the camp, the wall, and in the distance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See two men turning left along a pathway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a helmet glittering among the shadows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Euryalus’ prize and foolishness. They notice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once, of course, and challenge. From the column<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Volcens cried out:&mdash;“Halt! Who goes there? Who are you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are you doing in arms? Upon what mission?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No answer: flight to wood and trust in darkness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the horsemen, fanning out, block every cross-road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Circle and screen each outlet. Wide with brambles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dark with holm-oak spreads the wood; the briars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fill it on every side, but the path glimmers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the rare intervals between the shadows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Euryalus is hindered by the branches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The darkness, and the spoil he carries; terror<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes him mistake the path. Nisus is clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reaching the site that later men called Alba,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where king Latinus had his lofty stables.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_247" id="page_247">{247}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He halts, looks back to find his friend: in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Euryalus, Euryalus, where are you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where have I lost you? How am I to follow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back through the tangled wood, the treacherous thickets?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Euryalus, Euryalus!” He turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tries to retrace his step, is lost in the woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hears the horses, hears the shouts and signals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the pursuit comes closer, and he hears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cry, he sees Euryalus, dragged along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the treason of the night and darkness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bewildered by the uproar, fighting vainly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the hands of Volcens’ squadron. There is nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nisus can do, or is there? With what arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What force, redeem his friend? Or is it better<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hurl himself to death, dash in, regardless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To glorious wounds? His spear is poised, his arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn back; he looks to the moon on high, and prays:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Dear goddess, daughter of Latona, aid me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pride of the stars and glory of the groves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever my father Hyrtacus brought honors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my name to the altar, if ever I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have brought gifts home from my own hunting, aid me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me confound that troop, direct my weapon!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The straining body flung the spear; it whistled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the shadow of night, and Sulmo took it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his turned back; the point snaps off; it lodges<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With part of the splintered wood deep in the lungs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sulmo goes down, his mouth spurts blood, his body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sobs, straining, in the gasp and chill and shudder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a cold death. They look in all directions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_248" id="page_248">{248}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">See nothing. And another spear is flying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fiercer this time. This pierces Tagus’ temples,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clings, warm, in the split brain. And Volcens rages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cannot find the spearman, and his anger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has no sure place to go, but for his vengeance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns on Euryalus, sword drawn, and rushing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cries:&mdash;“You will pay for both of them, your blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be the atonement.” Nisus, from the darkness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrieks in his terror:&mdash;“Here I am, I did it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guilt is mine, let him alone, come get me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rutulians! How could he have dared or done it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God knows, the only thing he did was love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A luckless friend too well.” But the sword is driven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the breast. Euryalus rolls over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blood veins the handsome limbs, and on the shoulder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The neck droops over, as a bright-colored flower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Droops when the ploughshare bends it, or as poppies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sink under the weight of heavy summer rainfall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nisus rushes them; he is after Volcens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Volcens alone. They mass around him, cluster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Batter him back, but through them all he charges,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whirling the blade like fire, until he drives it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full in the face while the Rutulian, shrieking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes down, and Nisus, dying, sees him die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falls over his lifeless friend, and there is quiet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the utter peace of death.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The limbs, dismembered, and the mangled body?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this thing all you bring me from the wars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this what I have followed on land and sea?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you have anything of decent feeling,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And strike with the bolt of lightning; hurl to Hell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The life I hate; no other way is left me<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Trojan spirit sank, and a groan of sorrow<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Under their tortoise-shield, in a wild hurry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fill the moat, tear down the wall: some sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A quick way in, or over, with scaling-ladders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the ring of men is thin, and light breaks in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where no men stand. And in reply the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rain every kind of weapon down&mdash;long war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has taught them how the walls must be defended.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They use crude poles to push men off the ladders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They roll tremendous boulders to crush the ranks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Covered by shields, and glad of that protection,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too little now, too small for the great rock<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where the clump of men is thickest. The back of the tortoise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is broken, like the bodies of men beneath it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more blind war, like this, for the Rutulians!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They change their tactics, sweep the wall with arrows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mezentius, grim to look at, works with firebrands,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Within, and found no way to flee, and shifted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the undamaged portion, when all of a sudden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lopsided under the weight, it toppled crashing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And filled all heaven with thunder. Half dead already<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men reached the ground, and the tower came down upon them,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who sent him off to Troy in arms (forbidden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since arms were not for slaves), a naked sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shield with no device. He saw himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in the midst of Turnus’ thousands, marshalled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him and behind him. There he stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a wild animal, ringed in by hunters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raging against their weapons, and sure of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaping upon them,&mdash;so Helenor, certain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To die, rushed where the weapons were the thickest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lycus was swifter afoot: through men, through weapons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gained the wall, reached up to pull himself over,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hot on his heels:&mdash;“You fool,” he cried in triumph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_253" id="page_253">{253}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Did you think you were out of reach?” And as he hung there,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">An eagle, so, sweeps up again to heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a white swan or rabbit in his talons;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ilioneus knocks over one, Lucetius,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With a rock as big as a mountain. Liger slew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emathion with a javelin; Asilas<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Itys, Promolus, Sagaris, and Idas.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the fool had flung his shield aside, to carry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand to his side, and an arrow pinned it there,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A young man in the battle, the son of Arcens,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There was thunder on the left, and in that instant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal bow-string twanged. The shaft came flying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through air, and the steel split the hollow temples<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Disguised as ancient Butes, armor-bearer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once, to Anchises, a guardian at his threshold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Later Ascanius’ servant. With his voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His grizzled hair, his color, his sounding arms,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">That gave them courage; and the column thickened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they were firm, and stood. And very slowly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turnus drew back, retreating toward the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they came on, more boldly now, with yelling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And massing rank on rank, a crowd of hunters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With deadly spears, after a deadly lion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the beast they hunt is frightened, but still deadly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still dangerous, still glaring, and neither anger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor courage lets him turn his back, and forward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cannot go, however much he wants to,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all that press of men and spears. So Turnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubtful, kept stepping back, little by little,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning, inside, with anger. Two more times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He made a sudden charge, sent the foe flying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the walls, but they came back, and Juno<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dared not assist him further; Jove had sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iris from heaven, with no uncertain message<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Turnus does not leave the Trojan ramparts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He can no longer hold his own against them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shield and sword-arm falter; darts like hail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rain down from everywhere. The helmet rings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around his temples, and the brass cracks open<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the storm of stones; the horsehair crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is shot away; the boss of the shield is dented;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_262" id="page_262">{262}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mnestheus, with lightning force, and other Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Multiply spears. The sweat all over his body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs in a tarry stream; he cannot breathe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, with one great leap, in all his armor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He plunges into the stream, and Tiber takes him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the yellow flood, held up by the buoyant water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Washing away the stains of war, a hero,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning happily to his warrior-comrades.<br /></span>

<big>ARMS<br /> AND THE MAN</big></h2>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Meanwhile all-powerful Olympus flings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The palace open wide: the council meets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Jove’s command, under the starry dwelling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From which he sees all lands, the Trojan camp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Latin people. Between the double doors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They find their places. Jupiter speaks first:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Great dwellers in Heaven, why the change of heart?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do you fight with hostile spirit? I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had said, I thought, that Italy and the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were not to meet in war. Why, then, this brawling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In face of my command? What fear has driven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This side or that to arms and provocation?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proper time will come&mdash;be in no hurry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Carthage, fierce and wild, will loose destruction<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the heights of Rome, and spring the Alps wide open.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hate will be lawful then, and ravage, and battle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, subside; be friendly; accept my order.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So Jupiter spoke, briefly, but golden Venus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was far from brief in answer:&mdash;“O great father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_264" id="page_264">{264}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sovereign of men and destiny forever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What other power is there for us to pray to?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you see, I ask you, these Rutulian warriors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all their insolence? Have you noticed Turnus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Riding on horseback through their midst, all swollen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Mars as second? The barricaded walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer shield the Trojans. The battle rages<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the gates, on the high towers; the trenches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swim deep in blood. Aeneas does not know it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is far away. Must siege go on forever?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this your will? Another enemy threatens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The walls of Troy, new-born, another army<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes from Aetolian Arpi; Diomedes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more attacks the Trojans. Wounds for me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are still to come, I well believe; your daughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waits for a mortal outrage, not the first one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans came to Italy: was the coming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With your consent, by your design? If not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, let them pay the penalty, do not help them!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or were they following order after order<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Given by gods above, by gods below?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If so, who dares to overturn your justice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who dares create new fates? Do I have to mention<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fleet on fire in Sicily, the winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let loose by Aeolus, their king, or Iris<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent through the clouds? And now she is even rousing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This chance she had not yet taken&mdash;the shades of Hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here is Allecto, suddenly given license<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the upper world, and ravaging and raving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the Italian cities. As for empire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_265" id="page_265">{265}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I care no more about it. I was hopeful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fortune still existed. Let the winners<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be those you want to win: have it your way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If that tough wife of yours will give the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No land in all the world, no realm whatever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I beg you, father, by the smoking ruins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of shattered Troy, let me spare one, Iulus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him, at least, be saved from war. Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of course, will still be tossed on unknown waters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Following any course that fortune offers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me protect his son. I have Amathus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High Paphus and Cythera, Idalia’s groves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There he may live, laying aside his weapons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long inglorious lifetime. Order Carthage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crush Ausonia with her empire; nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall interfere with Tyrian towns. Much good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It did him to escape the plague of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have fled through Argive burning, to have exhausted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All dangers of the land and the great ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking for Latium and a new-born Troy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much good indeed! It would have been much better<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the very soil of Troy and her last ashes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have been the new foundation for their dwelling.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give the poor wretches Simois and Xanthus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father, once more; I pray you, let the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live, once again, the fall of Troy!” And Juno<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst out in anger:&mdash;“Why do you compel me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break my silence, to make my sorrow vulgar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With words for the world’s ear? What god, what mortal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forced war upon Aeneas? Who advised him<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_266" id="page_266">{266}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To advance, an enemy, against Latinus?<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He came to Italy at the fates’ command</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So be it; but what about Cassandra’s ravings?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was I the one&mdash;I must have been&mdash;who told him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave the camp, to trust his life to the winds?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was I the one who told him to make a boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The captain of the wall? Was it I who told him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek Etruscan allies, to hunt down people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who meant no harm? What god, what power of mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drove him to all his cheating? What has Juno<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Iris, sent through the clouds, to do with this?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disgraceful and disgusting, that Italians<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threaten the walls of Troy, new-born; that Turnus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stay in his native land, Turnus, descended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself from king and goddess. What about it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What about this, that Trojans harry Latins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With smoking brand and violence, set their yoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On fields not theirs, and carry off the plunder?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who let them know whose daughters to wed, or ravish?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who told them to hold out the hand for peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And arm the ships for war? Oh, you are able,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of course you are, to give them mist for a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To steal Aeneas from Greek hands; you are able<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To turn their fleet to sea-nymphs, but if I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help the Rutulians even a very little,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is that so monstrous? <i>Aeneas does not know it;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He is far away.</i> Good. Let him still not know it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him still be far away. You have Amathus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High Paphus and Cythera; so why meddle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With savage hearts and a city big with war?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_267" id="page_267">{267}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, it seems, I am trying to pull over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wobbling walls of Troy! Really! Who was it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, or somebody else, who flung the Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor things, in the path of the Greeks? What was the reason<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Europe and Asia to rise in arms, break treaties<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over a piece of stealing? Was it I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shipped the adulterer Paris out to Sparta?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it I who armed his lust? That was the time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have had some fear for those poor suffering Trojans.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is too late now. You rise to the occasion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With unjust whining and shrill scolding nonsense.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So Juno argued: the company of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sided with one or the other, and the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was like the sound of winds caught in the forest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sailors, listening, know that storms are coming.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Jupiter all-powerful, the ruler<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the world, began, and with his word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lofty palace of the gods grew quiet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth’s foundations trembled, and the winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were still, and the loud ocean hushed the waters.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Take these my words to heart; be sure to heed them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is forbidden Ausonians and Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To join in concord; the arguments among you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems, will never end. Therefore I tell you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether a man is Trojan or Rutulian,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever luck he has to-day, whatever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hopes to have to-morrow, it does not matter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I treat them both the same. It may be fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may be Trojan foolishness and error<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_268" id="page_268">{268}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That keeps the camp besieged: I do not judge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hold Rutulians under obligation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well as Trojans. In every man’s beginning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His luck resides, for good or ill. I rule<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All men alike. The fates will find the way.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all Olympus trembled as he nodded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swore by the waters of his Stygian brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pitchy banks and the black seething torrent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no more talking. From his golden throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jove rose, with gods and goddesses attending<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In deferential escort.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">In the meantime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At every gate Rutulians drive, determined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring down men with steel, ring walls with flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The host of Troy is held inside, blockaded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With never a hope of flight. Wretched, they stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the high towers, in vain; they are none too many<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stretch the circle out. Imbrasus’ son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asius, is there; Thymoetes; two young men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assaracus’ sons; and Castor, and old Thymbris,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the front ranks; two brothers of Sarpedon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clarus and Thaemon, with them; they came from Lycia.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One man, with every ounce of strength, is heaving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lift a giant boulder, half a mountain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That would be Acmon, Clytius’ son: Lyrnesus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their home, produced enormous men&mdash;a brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mnestheus, too, was something of a giant.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rocks are weapons of defense, and arrows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And darts, and balls of fire, and fighting men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are busy with them all, and the little Trojan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_269" id="page_269">{269}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pet of Venus, rightly so, was with them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bare-headed, a handsome sight, a shining jewel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inlaid in yellow gold, or a medallion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ivory in terebinth or boxwood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shone Iulus, whose white neck and shoulders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed whiter where the blond hair fell, and the circlet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gold made bright the golden hair. Ismarus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was there, an archer, whose shafts were dipped in poison,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A warrior far from his Maeonian homeland<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Pactolus floods the fields with yellow gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mnestheus was there; he had beaten Turnus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day before, and knew it, and was proud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Capys fought beside him: his name was given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a city, later,&mdash;Capua, south of Rome.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So these men had been fighting, clash and conflict<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the rough shock of warfare, as Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At midnight, cleaved the seas. He had left Evander,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had found the Tuscan camp, he had told the king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His name, his race, his need, what help he brought him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told Tarchon of Mezentius, of the spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of violence in Turnus; had given warning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, always, men need help; had made appeal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Tarchon promptly answered: so the people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were free from fate’s injunction, free for war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having a foreign leader. Aeneas’ ship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Headed the column, her figure-head a mountain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lions at the base, familiar Ida,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear to the Trojan exiles. And Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sailed on toward war and all those changing fortunes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pallas stayed beside him, asking questions:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_270" id="page_270">{270}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What stars were those? which was the one to guide them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the dark night? what fortunes had he suffered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On land and sea?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Fling wide the gates, O Muses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inspire the song: what force rides with Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Tuscan shores, what warships sail the ocean?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Massicus leads the way in the bronze <i>Tiger</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand men on board; they have come from Clusium,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Cosae’s city, archers all, with quivers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light on their shoulders, and their bows are deadly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With them is glowering Abas; a gold Apollo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleams on his bowsprit, and the vessel blazes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With men in armor; the little island Ilva,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich in her mines, had sent them, thrice a hundred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Populonia furnished twice as many.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Third comes Asilas, priest and augur, learnèd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the signs, diviner of stars and lightning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of birds and entrails; he brings a thousand spearmen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Pisa, on Etruscan soil. And Astur<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follows, a handsome horseman, with three hundred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stalwarts from Caere, Minio, and Pyrgi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud, confident men, with arms of many colors.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cinyras is there, the bravest leader<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all Ligurian captains, and Cupavo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With none too many followers; his crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is white swan-plumage, a token of his father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, so they say, loved Phaethon, and grieved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over his fall from heaven, and made music<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heal his sorrow, under the poplar trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Phaethon’s sisters haunted, and so, singing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_271" id="page_271">{271}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Became a bird, all white and soft, and vanished<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From earth, and was a crying voice in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cygnus, the swan. And now his son Cupavo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes to the wars, driving his ship, the <i>Centaur</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which towers high as a cliff; the long keel furrows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wide wake over the sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">And Ocnus summons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men from his native shores, Ocnus, the son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a Tuscan river and a woman, Manto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gifted in prophecy; her name was given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Mantua, rich in ancestors, one city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three races, each one master of four peoples,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mantua the queen of all, her power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure in Tuscan strength. From here Mezentius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rouses five hundred men in arms against him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mincius, Benacus’ son, crowned with grey rushes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brings them down to the sea. On comes Aulestes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose <i>Triton</i> wallows heavily in the waters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a hundred oars lashing the waves to foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the blue waters tremble at the sea-god<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Riding the prow, conch at his lips, a figure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaped like a shaggy man, as far as the belly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then a fish or serpent, a great sea-monster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under whose weight the water sucks and gurgles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the bronze vessels come, thirty good ships<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the help of Troy, and men, and chosen leaders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the salt sea plains.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">And day had gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dear moon in her night-wandering chariot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was halfway up the sky; Aeneas, restless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_272" id="page_272">{272}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tended the sails and rudder, holding the course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a band of his own company came to meet him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those goddesses, whom Cybele had ordered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rule the seas that once they sailed. They knew him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their king, far off, circled his ships in greeting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cymodocea, of them all most gifted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ways of speech, clung to the stern; one hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted her out of the water, and the other<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept plying under the waves. She hailed Aeneas:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Are you on watch, son of the gods? Be watchful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowd on full sail! We are the pines of Ida,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born from that sacred mountain. Nymphs of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We used to be your fleet. But treacherous Turnus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drove us with fire and sword; against our will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We broke our bonds to you, and now we seek you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the deep. The mother of the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took pity on us, and made us goddesses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal under the waters. We have bad news; your son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is under siege; walls hold him in, and trenches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the air is filled with darts, and the wild Latins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bristle in war. The cavalry of Pallas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the brave Etruscan allies, minding orders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold their appointed station. Turnus knows it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turnus is certain to send opposing squadrons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep them from the camp. Hurry, then, hurry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Get the men armed by daylight; raise the shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Given by Vulcan, the invincible armor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright with its ring of gold. To-morrow morning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall see, unless I speak in foolish error,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great heaps of slain Rutulians.” She finished speaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_273" id="page_273">{273}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she left the ship, her right hand gave it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An expert shove, and it sped over the water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swifter than javelin or flying arrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the other vessels quickened pace. Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marvelled, amazed, and the portent cheered his spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looked up to the vault of heaven, praying:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Dear mother of the gods, Idean queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lover of tower-crowned cities, and the lions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That draw the chariot, be my leader now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the fight begins, affirm the omen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Favor the Trojans, goddess, with your blessing.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he spoke, new day broke over the ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a great blaze of light, and the darkness vanished.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">It was time for the last warnings to his comrades:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Follow the signals, nerve the spirit for battle,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Make every preparation!</i> And he stood there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on the stern, seeing, before his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans and his camp, and he lifted high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blazing shield, and the Trojans raised a clamor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the high stars; new hope inflamed their anger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the darts flew, as cranes come back to Strymon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noisy before the southern gales. But Turnus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Rutulian leaders were dumbfounded,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What miracle was this?&mdash;looked back and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sterns lined up to the shore, the whole great ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One mass of moving ships. The helmet burned,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Never lost confidence or nerve; he would beat them<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Men, here is what you always prayed for; do it!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Break through with sword-arm! Mars is in your hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember, every man, his wife, his household,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fathers’ noble glories. On to meet them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the water’s edge: they tremble there, they stagger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And luck helps men who dare.” He chose his captains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Picked men for this attack, and left to others<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The duty of the siege.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Meanwhile Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Landed his comrades, down from the tall ships,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the gangways. Many leapt boldly down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catching the ebb of the sea, and others vaulted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the oar-blades. Tarchon, watching the shore-line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw where the shallow water was hardly breathing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where never a breaker roared, where the smooth ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came gliding slowly in, and he turned his prow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calling on comrades:&mdash;“Now is the time, bend to it,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Let the beaks split this hostile land, and keels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plough a deep furrow: what does a shipwreck matter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we take hold of land?” And as he urged them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rose to the oars, they drove the foaming ships<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the dry Latin fields, and every vessel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came in, unhurt, except for one. For Tarchon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran up on a ledge of rock and hung there, doubtful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tilting now back, now forward, until he broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_275" id="page_275">{275}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the weary wave, and the timbers weakened,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Among the broken oars and the floating cross-beams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the drag of the undertow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">No lazy dawdling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held Turnus back; he hurled his lines against them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stopped them at the shore. Aeneas charged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas was the first invader, Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck down the Latin countrymen, killed Theron,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The biggest of them all. That was an omen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theron had taken extra pains to meet him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the sword went through his mail and through his tunic<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pierced his side and drank his blood. Next, Lichas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was slain, Apollo’s devotee, at birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut from the womb of his dead mother: the child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Escaped the steel, but not the man. Two others,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of them tough, one huge, Cisseus, Gyas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went down before Aeneas. They were fighting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With clubs, as Hercules used to, and much good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It did them, though their father was Melampus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had been with Hercules through many labors.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then there was Pharus, who had his mouth wide open,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For boast or taunt, and got a javelin in it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flung by Aeneas’ hand. Cydon loved Clytius,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And followed him everywhere, his golden darling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would have had a lesson in forgetting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All his beloved young men, falling a victim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under Aeneas’ hand, but his seven brothers,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each one let fly a dart: helmet and shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned them aside, or they only grazed the body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Venus’ help. “Achates,” cried Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Bring up more weapons! Any I ever landed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In bodies of the Greeks, on the plains of Ilium,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will never miss Rutulians here.” He snatched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A great spear up, and flung it; it went flying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Maeon’s shield of bronze; it rent the breastplate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It tore the breast, went through, and struck Alcanor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the right arm around his falling brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pierced the arm, and kept its bloody journey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the dead arm dangled from shoulder-sinew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Numitor ripped the spear from his brother’s body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aimed at Aeneas, missed, but grazed Achates.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Clausus from Cures, proud of his young body,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of voice&mdash;he tried to speak&mdash;and life together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dryops’ forehead hit the ground, and blood<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Doubtful and long, and nothing yields, not wind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Foot tramples foot, man grapples man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And inland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On ground where a raging stream had sent stones rolling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And torn the bushes from the banks, the horsemen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had to be infantry, for the rough ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbade the use of chariots. Their nerve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was at low ebb; they fled. And Pallas saw them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And being their one hope, with scorn and prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rallied their courage:&mdash;“Where do you flee, Arcadians?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By your own brave deeds I beg you, by your king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the old wars won in Evander’s name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By my own hopes to match my father’s praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trust not to flight. The sword must cut the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where that mass of men comes thickest toward us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That way we go, with Pallas as your leader<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our country calls; no gods pursue us: men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are being chased by men, with no more hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With no more lives than we have. Ocean blocks us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his great dam; earth offers us no haven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are we bound for Troy or the sea?” And he dashed in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the enemy was thickest. Lagus came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet him; fate was far from kind to Lagus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was trying to lift a stone when Pallas hit him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the javelin stuck in the spine between the ribs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Pallas pulled it loose again. Then Hisbo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoped to surprise him and failed; he came in rushing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reckless and angry over the death of Lagus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_278" id="page_278">{278}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pallas was ready for him, and drove the sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the swollen lung. He went for Sthenius,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Anchemolus, of Rhoetus’ ancient line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The consort of his stepmother in incest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he saw twin brothers, sons of Daucus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Named Thymber and Larides, whom their kinsmen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could never tell apart, and their own parents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made fond mistakes about them. But Pallas made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Them different, once for all; Evander’s sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut off the head of Thymber; Larides’ hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Severed, looked blindly for its arm, the fingers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closed, quivering and dying, on the sword.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So the Arcadians rallied; his example<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armed them with shame and rage. Tyres and Teuthras,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arcadian brothers, started after Rhoeteus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fled, and that saved Ilus’ life, for Pallas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had flung a spear at Ilus, but Rhoeteus, driving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into its path, received it, rolled from the chariot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his heels kicked the ground in death’s convulsion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as in summer, when a shepherd kindles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire here and there among the brush or forest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waits for wind, and hears it rise, and swiftly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The many fires are one great blaze, and Vulcan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Takes charge of all the field, above the battle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching victorious, so Pallas’ comrades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept in from all directions, bright and burning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward him, their focus and centre. And Halaesus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came on to meet them, pulling himself together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Setting himself for battle. He killed Ladon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pheres, Demodocus: Strymonius threatened<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_279" id="page_279">{279}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His throat with the gleaming sword, and for his trouble<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Got his right hand cut off, and then Halaesus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bashed Thoas’ head in with a rock and scrambled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His skull-bones, blood and brains. Halaesus’ father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knew his son’s destiny and tried to spare him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hiding him in the woodlands, but grew old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could not watch forever, and when his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were blind in death, the fates reached out, Halaesus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could not avoid his doom. Pallas attacked him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Praying before he flung the spear:&mdash;“O Tiber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grant to the steel I poise and hurl good fortune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pathway through the breast of tough Halaesus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your oak will hold his arms and spoil as trophy.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tiber heard the prayer; Halaesus’ luck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran out, he had left himself exposed, to cover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imaon with his shield, and the bare breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took the Arcadian lance.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Lausus, unfrightened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself no little portion of war, fought on,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And cut him down; when Abas fell, a cluster<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of stubborn fight was broken. The young men die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arcadians, Etruscans, Trojan fighters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had survived Greek wounds; they come to grips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both armies, equal in leadership and valor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lines become columns, columns lines: all thickens<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On one side Pallas thrusts and strains, and Lausus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struggles to meet him, two young heroes, equal,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In handsome manliness; and both denied<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To meet the other; and both assured of finding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fate where a greater enemy is waiting.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Meanwhile the sister of Turnus brought him warning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lausus needs aid!</i> So, with his car, he drove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift through the ranks. “Break off, and give me room,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cried, “Room for my duel. I am bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To battle Pallas; Pallas is my prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My prize alone. I only wish his father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were here to watch!” Obedient, his comrades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave place, and as they yielded, Pallas stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Astonished at this arrogance, this giant:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took the whole scene in, undaunted, proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce, high in spirit, with a ready answer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Turnus’ taunting:&mdash;“Either I win my praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For kingly spoils or glorious death, and soon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father can face either: spare the threats!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he moved forward, and the blood ran chill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all Arcadian hearts. Down from his car<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jumps Turnus; he comes nearer, like a lion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sees far-off a bull, intent on battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stalks, and rushes; even so came Turnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came within spear-throw; Pallas, watching, knew it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took a step forward, and, that chance might favor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However uneven his strength, prayed to the heavens:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“If ever my father entertained a stranger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who proved a god, and gave him food and greeting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aid me, O Hercules! Let Turnus see me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taking the bloody armor from his body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_281" id="page_281">{281}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his dying eyes behold me, Pallas, victor.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young prayer touched the god: his grief was stifled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in his heart, and tears were vain; his father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke to him kindly:&mdash;“Every man, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has his appointed time; life’s day is short<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all men; they can never win it back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to extend it further by noble deeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the task set for valor. Even my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My own, and sons of other gods have fallen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under Troy’s lofty walls. Sarpedon, Turnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fate calls alike: the years for each are measured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goal in sight.” Jupiter, having spoken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shifted his eyes from the Rutulian landscape.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And Pallas flung the spear, full force, and drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flashing blade; the shaft sped on, it struck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where mail and shoulder met; piercing the shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It grazed the side of Turnus. And he poised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His long oak shaft with the sharp iron, hurled it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a taunt went with the toss:&mdash;“Which pierces deeper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your spear or mine?” So, through the plates of iron,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plates of bronze, the overlapping leather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the shield’s center drives the quivering point,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through stubborn mail, through the great breast. In vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas pulls out the dart, warm from the wound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His blood, his life, come with it, and he falls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubled upon his wound; the armor clangs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over his body; he strikes the hostile earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dying, with bloody mouth. Above him Turnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoicing, cries:&mdash;“Arcadians, take notice,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His left foot on the body, he ripped loose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The belt’s great weight, with the story of a murder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carved in its metal, the young men foully murdered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the bridal night, the chamber drenched in blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Clonus, son of Eurytus, engraved it.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Great sorrow and great glory, to his father.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“I beg you, by the shades of great Anchises,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By all the hope you have of young Iulus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spare me, a father and a son, for son<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One life like mine is nothing to the Trojans:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What difference will it make?” “Save for your sons,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas answered, “all that gold and silver.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When Pallas fell. The shades of great Anchises<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know this, my growing son, Iulus, knows it.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His left hand grasped the helmet; Magus felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head drawn back, he felt throat muscles tighten,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the Trojan hero, standing over his body,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Caeculus, born of Vulcan’s race, and Umbro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Marsian mountains, rallied the ranks. Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came storming toward them, hot from wounding Anxur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had been boasting loud, hoping that words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would make him more aggressive: there was no limit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To promises he made himself, long years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ripe old age&mdash;if so, he would be a cripple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man with no left hand: Aeneas lopped it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Off at the wrist, and the shield’s round circle with it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tarquitus, son of Dryope and Faunus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud in his gleaming arms, stood up against him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Briefly; the spear drove through the shield’s huge weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nailing it to the breastplate; all in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tarquitus pleaded, stammering and choking.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas gave his head a shove; the body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still warm, turned halfway over under his foot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dying, Tarquitus heard:&mdash;“Lie there, and scare me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Terrible warrior! No loving mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will ever bury your bones, no father build<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sepulchre above them. The birds of prey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will take you, or the waters of the flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And greedy fishes nibble your wounds and mouth them.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four more were slaughtered, Lucas and Antaeus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conspicuous in Turnus’ ranks, and Numa,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sun-burnt Camers, son of noble Volcens,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who had a hundred arms, and fifty mouths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From each of which came fire, and fifty swords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fifty shields, and rattled them together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defying Heaven’s thunderbolts and lightning,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such was Aeneas now, a victor raging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All up and down the field, with one sword only<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that one hot and red. He saw Niphaeus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driving his four swift horses, and went toward them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With terrible strides and cursing, and they bolted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook off the driver, dragged the car, a ruin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the shore of the sea. And then two brothers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring their white chariot on, Lucagus, Liger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom Lucagus whirls the sword in fighting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Liger plies the reins; they burn with fury,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than Aeneas can stand: he rushes, monstrous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A giant with a spear. And Liger taunts him:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Whoa! This is not Achilles’ car, these fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not Troy, these horses Diomedes’.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will get it now, the end of life and battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here on this ground.” Poor crazy-talking Liger!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas wastes no words; his lance comes flying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while Lucagus, leaning over the chariot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes of his sword a whip, his left foot forward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Setting himself for action, the point comes through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The low rim of his shield, drives on, and pierces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The groin on the left side. Lucagus topples,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writhes on the ground, and dies; and then Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has words for him, and bitter ones:&mdash;“Lucagus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your horses have not run away; they are brave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_286" id="page_286">{286}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are no traitors, shying at a shadow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are the one, it seems, the cheap deserter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who jump the wheels, leave the poor beasts forsaken.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He pulls the horses up; and down comes Liger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His luck all gone, his hands outstretched for mercy:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O Trojan hero, son of mighty parents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their remembrance, spare my life: Oh, hear me&mdash;”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was more he would have said. Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke in:&mdash;“Liger, that’s not the way you sounded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little while ago. What? Should a brother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave brother in the battle? Never. Die!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sword went its deadly way, exposing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirit’s hiding-place. Such was the carnage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dealt by Aeneas over the plain, a whirlwind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A flood of black destruction. And at the city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascanius and the warriors broke the siege,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came from the threatened camp.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And high in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jupiter spoke to Juno:&mdash;“Sister of mine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You are not wrong&mdash;Venus, who helps the Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead of their own right hands, war-quick, or spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aggressive in attack, enduring in danger.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Juno made meek answer:&mdash;“Why, dear husband,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trouble me further? I am sick at heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear your sad commandments. If I only<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had what I used to have, compelling love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would not, all-powerful king, refuse my pleading:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would let me rescue Turnus from the battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restore him safely to his father Daunus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_287" id="page_287">{287}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That would have been my prayer; but let him die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let innocent blood be forfeit to the Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No matter that his lineage is lofty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His origin from our stock; no matter, either,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The generous offerings he has made your altars.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The king of high Olympus thus made answer:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“If it is only respite and reprieve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You ask for this doomed youth, delay, postponement,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If that is all, and you realize I know it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take Turnus off by flight, snatch him from danger.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That much you are permitted. But if, beneath the prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some deeper hope lies hidden, if you are thinking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The war might change entirely, then you nourish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silliest kind of dreaming.” Juno, weeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied:&mdash;“But what if, in your heart, you granted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gift your speech refuses? What if Turnus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might still live on? No; heavy doom awaits him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else I am borne along in grievous error.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish my fear were false and I deluded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that the god, who has all power, would use it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To change things for the better.” And, having spoken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She veiled herself with cloud, came down from heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driving a storm before her, and sought Laurentum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojan line, the Latin camp, and fashioned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of a cloud, a hollow man, a figure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thin, weak, and curious to see, a phantom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A false Aeneas, dressed in Trojan armor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mimic shield and crest, with unreal language,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Voice without purpose, the image of a stride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the vain forms that flit when death is over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_288" id="page_288">{288}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like dreams that mock the drugged and drowsy senses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With arrogant joy this ghost went out parading<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the warriors’ ranks, brandishing weapons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taunting and daring Turnus, who came on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurled from afar the whirring spear; the phantom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned and made off, and Turnus, in confusion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nourished an empty hope: Aeneas, he thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had turned away, was gone. “What now, Aeneas?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where do you flee? Do not desert the bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The marriage chamber!” And he drew the sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glittering as he challenged, and did not notice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds sweep off his happiness. Near by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moored to a shelf of rock, a ship was standing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ladders let down, and gangplank set; a king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had sailed therein from Clusium. The ghost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The false Aeneas, hurrying, found shelter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the hold, and Turnus followed after,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hot-foot through all delays, leaped onto the deck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had no sooner reached the bow than Juno<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke off the mooring-lines, and the ship went scudding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the yielding sea. The real Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept calling Turnus to the fight, kept killing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Any who crossed his path. But the frail image<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer sought a hiding-place, but swept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High to the darker clouds, with Turnus riding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gale far out to seaward. Ignorant still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ungrateful for reprieve, he looked to shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raising his hands to heaven, and praying:&mdash;“Father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What have I done, to be so tricked, so sullied?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What am I being punished for? Where am I?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_289" id="page_289">{289}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who am I, for that matter? Fugitive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And coward, will I ever see again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The camp, the walls? And all that band of heroes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who followed me and trusted me, I leave them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In death unspeakable, I see them wheeling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hear their dying groans. What am I doing?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What gulf, what chasm, is deep enough to hide me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pity me, winds; dash this accursèd vessel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On rocks, on reefs, on any savage quicksands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, Turnus, plead with all my heart, ah, strand me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond all reach, where rumor or Rutulian<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May neither one pursue me.” His doubting spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mad with so much disgrace, was undecided<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether to let the sword drive through the body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dive and swim for it, toward camp and Trojans.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times he tried each way, three times his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His will, were stayed by Juno in her mercy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tall ship, on wind and tide, was carried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On to Ardea, Daunus’ lofty city.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Meanwhile, at Jove’s command, Mezentius, burning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entered the fight, swept through the cheering Trojans.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Etruscan ranks rush on; against Mezentius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All turn their hate, their weapons. But he stands<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Plumes for the helmet. A rock brought down Latagus,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whose mother gave him birth on the same evening<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Hecuba was delivered of her firebrand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a wild boar, sheltered for many years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In woods of pine or tracts of marshland, nourished<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On reeds thick-grown, is driven from the mountains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the sharp-toothed hunting-dogs, and comes to the nets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And makes a stand, and snorts in savage anger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bristles up his shoulders, and no one dares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come any nearer, but they all assail him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At a safe distance, pelting him and shouting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he is fierce and bold and very stubborn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gnashing his teeth, and shaking off the weapons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even so, like that wild boar, Mezentius held them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At bay, all those who hated him; they dared not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close with the sword; they kept their distance, shouting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assailing him, but out of reach, with missiles.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bright in the ranks, flashing, maroon and crimson,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The way a hungry lion sees a deer<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Beyond the limit of strength? O foolish youngster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You love your father, I know, but fool yourself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With too much loving.” Lausus, in his madness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has never a thought of stopping, and Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feels anger rise against him, and the Fates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tie off the ends of Lausus’ thread: the Trojan<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_294" id="page_294">{294}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drives with the sword; it is buried in the body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep to the hilt. The little shield, frail armor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against so great a menace, could not hold it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pliant tunic, woven by his mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With golden thread, is no more help; the blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stains it another color, and through air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The life went sorrowing to the shades. And now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas changes. Looking on that face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So pale in death, he groans in pity; he reaches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if to touch him with his hand, in comfort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing, himself, how one can love a father.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Poor boy, what tribute can Aeneas offer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What praise for so much glory? Keep the armor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You loved so much: if there is any comfort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In burial at home, know I release you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To your ancestral shades and ashes. Further,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have one solace, this, that you have fallen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By great Aeneas’ hand.” He lifted Lausus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the bloody ground and raised the head, that dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth and blood should not defile its glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called the Etruscans closer, scornful of them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over their hesitation.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Meanwhile, Mezentius, by the wave of the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propped his slumped frame against a tree-trunk, staunching<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wound with water. The bronze helmet hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inverted, from the bough; the heavy arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay quiet on the meadow. Chosen men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were standing by. Sick, and with labored breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He let his chin fall forward, rubbed his neck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_295" id="page_295">{295}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">While over his chest the flowing beard was streaming.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over and over again, he asks and sends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Lausus: bring him back, he tells the men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those are the orders from his unhappy father.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they were bringing him back, a big man slain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a big wound. Mezentius knew the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sorrow from afar, before he heard it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fouled his gray hair with dust, flung up his arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clung to the body. “O my son, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was I so fond of living that I sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You to the sword for me, saved by your wounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alive when you are dead? The wound indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is driven deep, the bitterness of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes home. I was the one, my son, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stained your name with crime, with hatred, driven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From throne and sceptre. I have owed too long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The debt of punishment, and here I am,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Living, and never leaving men and light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I shall leave.” He heaved his sickened weight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pulling himself together, groin and all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly. The wound was deep, but he could stand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ordered them to bring his horse, that solace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pride of his, on which he used to ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Victorious out of all the wars. He spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the beast sorrowed with his master’s sorrow:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Rhoebus, if anything is ever long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For mortal beings, you and I have lived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a long time. Today you carry back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those bloody spoils, Aeneas’ arms, avenging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pangs of Lausus with me, or we both,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_296" id="page_296">{296}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If no force clears the way, go down together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O bravest heart, too noble to endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger’s order and the Trojan rider.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He swung astride, shifted his weight a little,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The way he always did, held in both hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A load of darts. The helmet glittered bronze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horsehair plume was bristling as he rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Madness and grief and shame all urging on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That singleness of purpose. He came on fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calling, <i>Aeneas! Aeneas!</i> over and over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his voice was loud and firm. Aeneas heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoiced, and recognized, and made his prayer:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Let this be true, O father of the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O high Apollo!"&mdash;then, to his foe, “Come on!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moved to meet him with the deadly spear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mezentius answered:&mdash;“Do you frighten me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all that fierceness, now that my son is taken?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How meaningless! That was the only way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You could destroy me. Now I fear no death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spare no god. Be quiet; for I come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To die, but first of all I bring you this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A present from me,"&mdash;and he flung the dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flung another, and another, wheeling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a great arc. The boss of gold held strong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times in circles to the left he rode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the steady Trojan; thrice the hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let fly the dart, and thrice the shield of bronze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was a great forest with its load of spears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this was wearisome,&mdash;too many darts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too much defensiveness. Aeneas broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_297" id="page_297">{297}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the watchful attitude, and flung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spear between the charger’s hollow temples.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great beast reared with fore-hooves flailing air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throwing the rider, and came tumbling down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Head-foremost on him, shoulder out of joint.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trojan and Latin uproar swelled to heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas, sword-blade ready, rushes in:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Where is the fierce Mezentius now, and where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that wild rage of spirit?” But the king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raising his eyes, drank in the sky a little,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knew a brief moment of recovery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough to say:&mdash;“O bitter enemy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why all the tauntings and the threats of death?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no wrong in slaughter: neither I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Lausus ever made such battle-pledges.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One thing I ask, if beaten enemies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have any claim on mercy. Let my body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be granted burial. I know the hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my own people rages round me. Keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fury from me. Let me share the grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my dear son.” He said no more, but welcomed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fully aware, the sword-thrust in the throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poured his life in crimson over the armor.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Meanwhile Aurora, rising, left the ocean.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas’ heart was troubled&mdash;so much dying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So great a need for funeral rites,&mdash;but first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vows must be paid for victory. At dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sets an oak-trunk on a mound, the branches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stripped off on every side, and hangs upon it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mezentius’ gleaming arms, the war-god’s trophy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He adds the crest, blood-stained, the broken darts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The riddled breast-plate; binds, to the left, the shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs from the neck the ivory sword. His comrades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hail him, and gather close around, and listen:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The greatest task is done: as for the future,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear not, my heroes! Here are spoils and first-fruits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one proud king; Mezentius is in our hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We march, now, on Latinus and his cities.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepare your arms, your nerve; let your hopes run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Onward before the war. When the gods grant us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raise our standards and to lead our army<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of this camp, let no delay impede us<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_300" id="page_300">{300}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through ignorance, no fear retard our courage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile, let us commit to earth the unburied bodies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our dear comrades, for no other honor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waits them below the world. Go, offer homage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The final rites to those whose blood has won us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This fatherland; let Pallas be sent home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the mourning city of Evander: Pallas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had courage, and the day was black that took him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the bitterness of death.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">He spoke with tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went back to the threshold, where old Acoetes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An armor-bearer, once, to king Evander,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, less happily, guardian over Pallas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept watch beside the body. A Trojan throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood all around, an honor-guard, and the women<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loosened their hair in ceremonial mourning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when Aeneas came, the lofty portal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounded with groaning and with lamentation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wailing reached the stars. He looked at Pallas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pillowed head, the face as white as snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jagged wound in the smooth breast, and spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could not check his weeping:&mdash;“Ah, poor youngster!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fortune, a little while, was happy for us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then turned evil and grudging, and refused me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joy of seeing you ride back in triumph<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To your father’s house with news of our new kingdom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have not kept my promise to Evander,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose arms went round me when I left, who sent me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win great empire, and who gave me warning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That these were men of spirit, tough in battle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_301" id="page_301">{301}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, perhaps even at this very moment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dupe of empty hope, he is making prayers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaping the altars high with gifts, while we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sorrow attend his lifeless son, with honor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As empty as the father’s hope, for Pallas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Owes nothing more to any god in heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy Evander, our long-awaited triumph,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our glorious return, comes to this only,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bitter funeral of a son; and so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas keeps his promise!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And yet, O king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will not see him slain by shameful wounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will not long for a dire death to cancel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The memory of a son, safe, but a coward.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have lost a great protection, all of us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ausonia, Iulus.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">He gave orders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raise the pitiful body for its journey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chose a thousand men to honor Pallas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this last escort, to share Evander’s tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor comfort for so great a grief, but due him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men weave the bier with osier and soft willow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shadow it over with leaves of oak, and Pallas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rests on his country litter, like a flower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some girl has picked and lost, a violet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or drooping hyacinth, and all its luster<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still there, though earth is kind to it no longer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then Aeneas brought two robes, whose crimson<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was stiff with gold, robes that the queen of Carthage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had woven for him, happy in her labor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_302" id="page_302">{302}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Running the gold through crimson. Over Pallas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The robes are cast, the sad and final honor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hair is veiled for the fire, and many trophies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are added, prizes from the Latin battles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horses, and weapons, captured from the Latins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And human victims, offerings to the shades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their blood to sprinkle funeral fire, are led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hands bound behind them, and the names of foemen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are cut in the trunks of trees that bear their armor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy old Acoetes trudges with them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beating his breast, clawing his face, or flinging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wretched body down in the dust. And chariots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follow, Rutulian blood on wheel and axle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pallas’ war-horse Aethon, riderless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without caparison, weeps for his master,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great tears rolling down. Other men carry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spear and helmet only, for the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turnus had taken as spoil. And then there follows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long array of mourners, Trojans, Tuscans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arcadians, with arms reversed: so they pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In long procession, comrade after comrade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far on and almost out of sight. Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Halts, and sighs deeply:&mdash;“The same grim fates of war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call us from here to other tears. Forever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hail, O great Pallas, and farewell forever!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said no more, but turned to the high walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strode back to the camp.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">And envoys came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the Latin city, veiled with boughs of olive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asking for truce: let him return the bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_303" id="page_303">{303}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strewn by the sword across the battlefield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let them be given burial. No war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fought with vanquished men, deprived of light:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him be merciful&mdash;had he not called them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hosts at one time, and fathers? And good Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Granted, of right, the truce they sought, and added<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brief words:&mdash;“What evil destiny, O Latins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Involved you in such tragic war, to flee us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your friends that might have been? You ask for peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace for the dead, slain by the lot of battle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace? I would gladly grant it to the living.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would not be here unless fate had given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This place, this dwelling, and I wage no war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against your people, but your king deserted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our friendliness; he had more confidence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Turnus’ weapons. Turnus, in simple justice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should be the one to face this death. If, truly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seeks to end the war, to drive the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By strength of hand from Italy, he should have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taken my personal challenge: one of us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would live, to whom his own right hand or heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had granted life. Go now, depart in peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kindle the death-fires for your luckless comrades.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke, and they were silent: they had nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That could be said; they could not face him, either,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kept their eyes and faces toward each other.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And then old Drances, always bitter and hateful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resentful of young Turnus, spoke in answer:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O great in glory, even greater in arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heroic Trojan, how can I ever praise you<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_304" id="page_304">{304}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As highly as I should? Am I to wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First at your justice or your warlike prowess?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall be glad, indeed, to take these words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to our native city and, fortune willing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Join you with king Latinus. As for Turnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him seek his own alliances! Our pleasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will be in building walls for you, as fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ordains, that we should carry on our shoulders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The masonry of Troy.” And they all cheered him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They pledged twelve days for peace, and in the forests<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trojans and Latins walked as friends together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the ridges, peace among them. Ash-trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang as the two-edged axe bit deep; the pines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Star-towering, came down; the oak, the cedar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Split by the wedges, filled the groaning wagons.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And Rumor, messenger of all that mourning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came flying to Evander’s home and city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rumor, so short a time before the herald<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of victories in Latium for young Pallas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out to the gates came the Arcadians; torches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carried aloft, after the ancient custom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marked off the fields from highway; the long road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone with the light of fire, and the Trojans, coming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Met their lament, and when the mothers saw them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The city itself was one great fire of mourning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No force could hold Evander back: he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushing, into the sad procession’s center,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the barrow halted, clung to Pallas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping and groaning, and his voice could hardly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Manage its way through choking sobs:&mdash;“Ah, Pallas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_305" id="page_305">{305}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have not kept your promise to your father!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You said you would be careful in the battles!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew, I knew too well, how much new glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How much the sweet fresh pride in the first battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could overpower discretion. Here are the first-fruits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your young manhood; here are the cruel lessons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of war brought home; and all my prayers unheeded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By any god! But my dear wife is happy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spared, by her death, this anguish. I live on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have overcome my fate by living so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A father who survives his son. I should have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed the Trojan arms, let the Rutulians<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’erwhelm me with their darts; I should have died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this procession brought me home, not Pallas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not your fault, O Trojans; I do not blame you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The treaties joined, the hands we clasped, in friendship.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No: this was coming to me, this was due<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lot of my old age. An early death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took off my son; I shall rejoice, hereafter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing he led the Trojans into Latium,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slew Volscians by the thousands. He was worthy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas, my son, of such a death. Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty Trojans, the Etruscan captains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Etruscan ranks, all think so. They bring trophies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great trophies, those my son brought low; and Turnus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would be another trophy, were his years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His strength, the same as his young enemy’s.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But why am I, unhappy man, delaying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojan hosts from battle? Go: remember<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell Aeneas this: I keep on living,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_306" id="page_306">{306}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">However hateful life may be, with Pallas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taken away from me, I keep on living<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because of his right hand: it owes me something,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The death of Turnus, for the son and father.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this Aeneas knows, the one thing wanting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make his praise and fortune sure. I ask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No joy in life&mdash;that is impossible&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But only this one thing, to take my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the shades below, one message: Turnus has fallen.”<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Meanwhile the dawn had brought to weary mortals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her kindly light, and work again, and labors.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the winding shore Aeneas, Tarchon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set up the pyres, and all, as had their fathers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought bodies of their kinsmen, lit the fires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That burned, but darkly, and the light of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was hidden by the blackness of that shadow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times, in glittering armor, they went riding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the funeral blaze, three times they circled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mournful fire and cried with wailing voices.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears fell on earth and armor; heaven heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The groans of men, the blare of trumpet. Spoils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went to the fire, the handsome swords, the helmets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bridles and shining wheels, and well-known gifts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For men who died, their shields, their luckless weapons.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bullocks were slain, and bristly swine, and sheep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all the fields, homage to fire and death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all along the shore, they watched their comrades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burn on the pyres, and guarded the dead embers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could not leave till day had gone, and night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dewy with gleaming stars rolled over heaven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_307" id="page_307">{307}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And elsewhere in the countryside the Latins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Built, as the Trojans had, pyres without number.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many were slain, and many men were buried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where they had fallen, and many men sent home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their own cities, and many no one knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No one could mark with honor or distinction,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these were given one common pyre; the fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rivalled each other as the fires kept burning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three days had gone; and over bones and ashes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They heaped the earth, still warm. Inside the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the city of that rich king Latinus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grief swelled from murmur to wailing, to loud uproar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The greatest share of sorrow. Brides and mothers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sisters and fatherless boys, crying and cursing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Denounced the evil war and Turnus’ marriage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They call on him, on Turnus alone, to settle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The issue with the sword; he is the one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their accusation cries, who wants the kingdom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All Italy for himself, and the highest honors.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Drances, savage, tips the balance further:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turnus, alone, (he says) is called on, Turnus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone is called to battle. But against them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a man has good to say of Turnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shadow of the queen’s great name protects him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he has been a mighty man in battle.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And during all this swirling burning tumult,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Envoys, who came from Diomede’s great city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought gloomy news: nothing had been accomplished<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all that toil and trouble; nothing gained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By gifts or gold or pleading, and the Latins<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_308" id="page_308">{308}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were left two choices, to seek for other allies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ask Aeneas for peace. Under the burden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that great grief even Latinus falters.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas is called by fate, the will of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is clear, the gods are angry; the fresh graves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before their eyes, bear more than ample witness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, he calls a council; all his leaders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stream through the crowded highways to the palace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in their midst, the oldest man among them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first in power, Latinus, far from happy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speaks from his throne,&mdash;the messengers from Arpi<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should tell what news they bring, in proper order,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sparing no single item. All were silent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obedient to his word, and Venulus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave the report:&mdash;“O citizens, we have seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Argive camp, and Diomede. We made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The journey safely through all kinds of perils.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have touched the hand by which Troy fell. That hero<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has his own city now, named from his father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Garganus’ conquered fields. We entered there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had leave to speak, offered our gifts, and told him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our name and country, why we came to Arpi,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">All over the world, has paid and kept on paying<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All kinds of punishment, all kinds of torture,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A band that even Priam would have to pity.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Minerva knows it, with her baleful star,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Euboea’s headland knows it, and Caphereus,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That cape of vengeance. From that warfare driven<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ulysses faced the Cyclops; Menelaus<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was exiled far to the west. Idomeneus<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Met shame beyond his threshold; Clytemnestra<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Struck with her evil hand,&mdash;the king of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The conqueror of Asia, fell, a cuckold<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Murdered in his own palace, at Mycenae.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To me the gods were kinder; they would not let me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">See home again, the wife I loved, the altars<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Take it from one who knows, how huge he rises<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Above that shield of his, with what a whirlwind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He rifles out that spear. If Troy had only<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Two other men as good, Greece would be mourning<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With doom the other way, and the towns of Argos<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Admit the conqueror. For ten long years<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They kept us waiting at that stubborn city,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the Greek victory was at a standstill<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through Hector and Aeneas; both were famous<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In spirit, both in feats of arms, Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The more devoted man. I tell you, join them<br /></span>

<span class="i15">The sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose, as he ended, like the sound of water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When rocks delay a flood, and the banks re-echo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stir and protest of the angry river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confusion, argument, in swirl and eddy,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the Ausonians brawled among each other,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muttered, and then subsided; and king Latinus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke from his lofty throne:&mdash;“I wish, O Latins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_311" id="page_311">{311}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decision had been taken in such matters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long while since; that would have been much better.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is no time for councils to be summoned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The enemy is at the gate. We are waging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A most unhappy war against a people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descended from the gods; we cannot beat them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No battles wear them down; if they are conquered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cannot let the sword fall from the hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever hope you had in Diomede,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget it. All your hope is what you are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you can see how little that amounts to.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have it all before your eyes; you have it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In your own hands, and most of it is ruin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lay no blame on any man; what valor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could do, it has done: the body of our kingdom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has fought with all its strength. We are bled to the white.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear, then, what I propose; I am not yet certain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entirely&mdash;here it is, in brief. We have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ancient tract of land, far to the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touching the Tuscan river, where our natives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rutulians, Auruncans, sow and harrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stubborn hills, rough land and cattle country.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let all this region and its high pine-forest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be ceded to the Trojans out of friendship;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us make fair terms and have them share our kingdom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here they may build and settle if they want to.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if their minds are bent on other borders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On any other nation, if they are able<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave our soil, let us build a navy for them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twenty good ships of oak, more if they need them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_312" id="page_312">{312}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have the timber at the water’s edge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All they need tell us is what kind, how many,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For us to give them workmen, bronze, and dockyards.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred spokesmen from the noblest Latins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should go with boughs of olive, bearing presents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talents of gold and ivory, the robe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The throne, of state, symbols of our dominion.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If not so fierce in war, no fool in council,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A trouble-maker, though; his mother was noble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father no-one much. He spoke in anger:&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Evil has come upon us, and bad omens.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will speak out, however much he threaten.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us have freedom to speak frankly. Mourning<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Dies out in darkness, while that confident hero,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confident, but in flight, attacks the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frightens heaven with arms. To all these gifts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Promised and sent the Trojans, add, O king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One more: let no one’s violence dissuade you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From giving your daughter in a worthy marriage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An everlasting covenant between us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_313" id="page_313">{313}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Why, Turnus, fountain-head of all our troubles<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Open and often? In war there is no safety.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The only proper pledge. You know I hate you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make no mistake in that regard. But still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, first of all, implore you, pity your people!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put off that pride: give in, give up, and leave us!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have seen enough of death and desolation.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In windy tongue and flying feet? I, beaten?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who says so? What foul liar calls me beaten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing the Tiber red with blood, Evander<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With panic fear, and praise those noble heroes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that twice-beaten race, despite the arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of King Latinus. Now the Myrmidons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or so we hear, are trembling, and their river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs backward in sheer fright, and Diomedes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now he pretends my threats, my anger, scare him&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nice artistic piece of work!&mdash;he sharpens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slander with apprehension. Listen to him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listen to me: I tell you, you will never<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lose such a life as yours by this right hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quit worrying, keep that great and fighting spirit<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I turn to you and more important counsels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_315" id="page_315">{315}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you have hope no longer in our arms,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Let us hold out helpless hands in supplication.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still, if only some of our valor, something&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy the men who died before they saw it!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if we still have any power, warriors<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Any ally at all, if any Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have ever died (their glory has been costly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well as ours, and the storm has no more spared them),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do we fail like cowards on the edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of victory? Why do we shudder and tremble<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the trumpet sounds? Many an evil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has turned to good in time; and many a mortal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fate has despised and raised. Diomede, Arpi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refuse us help; so be it. There are others,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is Messapus for one, Tolumnius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose luck is good, and all those other leaders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent by so many nations, and great glory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will follow Latium’s pride. We have Camilla<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Volscian stock, leading her troop of horsemen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her warriors bright in bronze. If I am summoned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone to meet Aeneas, if I alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am obstinate about the common welfare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If such is your decision, my hands have never<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found victory so shrinking or elusive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I should fear the risk. Bring on your Trojan!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him surpass Achilles, and wear armor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_316" id="page_316">{316}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made by the hands of Vulcan! Second to no one<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I, Turnus, vow this life to you, Latinus,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pricked by no gentle spur. However frightened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They call for arms, they make impatient gestures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young men shout, and the old ones moan and mutter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noise, from every side, goes up to heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud and discordant, the way jays rasp and chatter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or swans along Padusa’s fishy river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Utter their raucous clamor over the pools.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Turnus, seizing on the moment, cries:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“A fine time, citizens, to call a council,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sit there praising peace. The enemy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is up in arms against us!” That was all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he went rushing from the lofty palace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Volusus, arm the squadrons of the Volscians,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lead the Rutulians forth! Messapus, Coras,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_317" id="page_317">{317}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deploy the horsemen over the plains! You others,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of you, guard the city gates and towers!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest, be ready to charge where I direct you!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So Turnus gave excited orders: quickly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rush to the walls was on, all over the city.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Latinus left the council, sorely troubled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that sad hour, put off the plan he hoped for,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blaming himself in that he had not welcomed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More eagerly, his Trojan son Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the welfare of the city. And his men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were digging trenches, trundling stones, or setting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stakes in the ground, and pitfalls; and the trumpet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounded for bloody war; and boys and mothers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled in the gaps along the walls. Amata,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen, with a great throng of matrons, rode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Pallas’ temple on the heights; beside her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The girl Lavinia, cause of all that evil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went with head bowed and downcast eyes. The women<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Climbed on, and made the temple steam with incense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the threshold chanted sorrowful prayers:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O mighty power in war, Tritonian virgin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Break off his spear, lay low the Trojan robber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretch him in death before our lofty portals!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And Turnus, all impatience, hot for action,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buckles his armor, the ruddy breastplate gleaming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright with bronze scales, the greaves on fire with gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword snapped to the baldric. Still bareheaded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A golden blaze, he runs down from the fortress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exulting in his spirit: he has the foe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the throat already, in imagination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_318" id="page_318">{318}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see that fire when a stallion breaks his tether,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs from the stable, free at last, a monarch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the plain, and makes for the green pastures<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where mares are grazing, or splashes into the river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of sheer joy, and tosses his mane, and nickers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light plays across his neck and shoulders.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">To meet him came Camilla and her Volscians,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she reined in at the gate, dismounting quickly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all her band, at her example, followed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listening as she spoke:&mdash;“Turnus, if courage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has any right to confidence, I promise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dare, to meet the horsemen of Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dare, alone, to face the Etruscan riders.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me try, first, the dangers of the battle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You stay on guard as captain of the walls.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Turnus, gazing at the warrior-maiden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied:&mdash;“O glory of Italy, no words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mine can give you worthy thanks; your spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surpasses all the rest of them. Share with me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The work we have to do. Faithless Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rumor says, and scouts confirm, is sending<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cavalry, light-armed, to scour the plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he himself, crossing the mountain-ridges,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes down upon the city. I am planning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ambush for him, where the forest narrows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shadowy trails; I block both sides of the pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With soldiery in arms. Do you, Camilla,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take on the Etruscan horsemen, act as leader;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Messapus, a sharp fighter, will be with you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Latin squadrons and the troop from Tibur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_319" id="page_319">{319}</a></span>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Messapus and the other captains listened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To orders much like these, and they were heartened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Turnus left them, moving toward Aeneas.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There is a valley, winding, curving, fit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For stratagems of warfare, a narrow gorge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black with dense woods on either side; a trail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winds through it, narrow and difficult: above it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lies an unknown plain, a safe position<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether you charge from right or left, or stand there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaving great boulders down the mountain-shoulders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Turnus knows this region well, finds cover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Picks the terrain to suit him, waits and watches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dark menace of the woods.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And meantime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High in the halls of heaven, Latona’s daughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was talking to a nymph of hers, a maiden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her devoted company, named Opis.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diana’s words were sorrowful:&mdash;“Camilla<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is going forth to cruel war, O maiden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our soldier, all in vain, and dearer to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all the other girls; she has loved me long;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is no impulsive whim that moves her spirit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps you know the story&mdash;how her father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Metabus, ruler of an ancient city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Became a tyrant, and his people drove him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hatred from Privernum, and he fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through war and battles, taking as companion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To share his exile the little infant daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Camilla, she was called, after her mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose name was not so different, Casmilla.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_320" id="page_320">{320}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he was going on, toward ridge and woodland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long roads to loneliness, holding his daughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him on his breast, and weapons flying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every side against them, and the Volscians<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spreading the net of soldiers wide to catch them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Metabus went on, and came to a river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of its banks, the swollen Amasenus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foaming in flood from cloudburst. Could he swim it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought so, but he checked himself; he feared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the dear load he carried. He did some thinking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suddenly, or not quite all of a sudden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the only way. There was the spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His stout hand bore: it was strong and heavy, knotted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of seasoned oak, and he bound his daughter to it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gently, with bark of cork-wood all around her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carefully, to keep the missile’s balance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let his right hand weigh its heft a little,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then made prayer:&mdash;‘O gracious woodland-dweller,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diana, virgin daughter of Latona,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I consecrate my daughter to your service.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are your darts she holds, the very first ones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She ever carried; she comes to you, a suppliant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who flees her foe through pathways of the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accept her, O dear goddess, I implore you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make her your own. Her father, I commit her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, to the dubious winds.’ The arm drew back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whirring spear shot forward, and the waters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roared loud below, and over the rush of the river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Camilla, on the whistling spear, went flying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Metabus, as the great host came closer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_321" id="page_321">{321}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dove into the flood, and safe across, a victor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And happy, pulled the spear and girl together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the grassy turf, his votive offering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made to Latona’s daughter. No city ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received him to its walls or homes; he would not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his wild mood, give in to any city.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lived with shepherds on the lonely mountains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, where wild beasts lurked, in thorn and thicket<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He raised his child; his hands would squeeze the udders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wild mares for their milk. When she could stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And toddle a little, he armed her with a javelin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tiny pointed lance, and over her shoulder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung quiver and bow. There were no golden brooches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bind her hair, no trailing gowns: her dress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was black and orange tiger-skin. Her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew used to tossing childish darts, or whirling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The limber sling around her head; she learned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hit her targets, crane or snowy swan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she grew, many a Tuscan mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wanted her for this son, or that, but vainly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diana was her goddess, and she cherished,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intact, an everlasting love&mdash;her weapons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her maidenhood, were all she knew and cared for.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish she had never been so possessed, so ardent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For soldiery like this, attacking Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead of meeker game; she would have been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one most dear of all my dear companions.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now a bitter doom weighs down upon her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, O nymph, glide down from heaven to Latium,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, under evil omens, men join battle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_322" id="page_322">{322}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take these, my bow, my arrows; from my quiver<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draw the avenging shaft. His life is forfeit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trojan, Italian, whoever he is, whose wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Profanes the sacred body of Camilla.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when she has fallen, I will bring her home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By hollow cloud, both warrior and armor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unspoiled, untaken, to her native country,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home to her tomb, poor girl.” And swift through air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opis, on whirring wing, came down from heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dark whirlwind’s center.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were drawing near the walls, with Tuscan leaders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that host of cavalry, whose numbers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled squadron after squadron, and the horses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snorted and reared and fought the bit and bridle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light-stepping sideways; far and wide the field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bristled with iron harvest, and the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burned with the arms raised high. And here against them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come Messapus and Coras and his brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Latins, moving fast, Camilla’s squadron,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hands drawn back already, and lances flying:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All fire and noise and heat and men and horses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ride, keep riding, and the distance closes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spear-cast, and they halt, and a wild clamor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breaks out, the charge is on, they spur the horses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which need no spur, and from all sides they shower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The darts as thick as driving snow, the shadow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkens the sky. Tyrrhenus, wild Aconteus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Single each other out and come together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Head on, and the spears are broken, and men are thrown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_323" id="page_323">{323}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the horses, smashing their great chests together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come down with a crash; Aconteus is hurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a thunderbolt or something from an engine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Incredibly far off, and dies in the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lines waver, and the routed Latins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let fall their shields behind them, head for the city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Trojans in pursuit: Asilas leads them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They near the walls, and the Latins turn, and, shouting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wheel to the charge, and the Trojans break and scatter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With reins let loose. You are looking at the ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The way it comes, one wave, and then another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surging, receding, flooding, rushing shoreward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the cliffs in spray and foam or smoothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The farthest sand with the shallow curve, withdrawing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faster and faster, and undertow, slowly, slowly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dragging the shingle back, and the surface gliding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleek from the visible beaches. Twice the Tuscans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drove the Rutulians routed to the city;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice, driven back themselves, they slung behind them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shields, reversed, quick-glancing over their shoulders.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when, for the third time, they came together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stayed together, locked, all down the line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each man picked his man, and each man stayed there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rough fight rose and thickened. Dying men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Groaned, and the blood was deep, and men and armor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wounded horses and wounded men and bodies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of men and horses were in it all together.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Orsilochus found Remulus a warrior<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too tough to take head on, and flung his spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the head of the horse, instead, and left the iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_324" id="page_324">{324}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the ear, and the great beast, wounded, rearing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flailed the air with his forelegs, came down crashing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stunned rider, thrown, rolled over and over.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catillus killed Iollas, and another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herminius, giant in body, giant in arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Giant in spirit, a man who fought bare-headed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bare-shouldered, a fair-haired man, so huge in stature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He feared no wound. But through his shoulders driven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The quivering spear made way and bent him double,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writhing in pain. Dark blood flows everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword deals death; men look to wounds for glory.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">In the thick of the fight Camilla rages, wearing<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Euneus, faced her first, and her long spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced his unguarded breast. Rivers of blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured from his mouth; he chewed red dust, and dying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writhed on his wound. She stabbed the horse of Liris,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rider fell, and reached for the reins: Pagasus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched out a hand to help him, to break his fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Camilla slew the pair of them together:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amastrus next, Hippotas’ son: far off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her spear caught up with four, Tereus, Chromis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harpalycus, Demophoön. For each dart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent flying from her hand, a Trojan fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off she saw the huntsman Ornytus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Riding a native pony, in strange armor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wore a steer’s hide over his wide shoulders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wolf’s head for a helmet, with the jaws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide-open, grinning above his head; he carried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rustic kind of pike, and he was taller,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a full head, than all the others, easy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Target for any dart. She cried above him:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What did you think, O Tuscan?&mdash;You were chasing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beasts in the woods? The day has come when boasting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like yours is answered by a woman’s weapons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But after all, you take to the shades of your fathers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No little cause for pride&mdash;Camilla killed you!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then she slew Orsilochus and Butes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two of the mightiest Trojans, stabbing Butes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spear-point in the back, between the helmet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breastplate, where the flesh shone white, and shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung down from the left arm. Orsilochus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She fled from first, and, driven in a circle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_326" id="page_326">{326}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Became, in turn, pursuer; and, rising higher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought down the battle-axe, again, again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through armor and through bone: his pleas for mercy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Availed him nothing; the wound he suffered spattered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face with his warm brains. Next in her way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stunned to halt by abject terror came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A son of Aunus, an expert at lying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like all Ligurians. He could not escape her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knew he could not, but he might outwit her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or so he hoped. “What’s so courageous, woman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always on horseback? Forget the hope of fleeing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dismount; meet me on equal terms; try fighting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On foot for once. You will learn, I tell you, something,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The disillusion of that windy glory.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She took the challenge, burned with angry temper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned her horse over to another, savage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In equal arms, confronting him undaunted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With naked sword. He leaped into the saddle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much pleased with his sly stratagem, drove the rowels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the flanks, took off. “O vain Ligurian,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swollen with pride of heart, that slippery cunning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will never get you home to father Aunus!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So cried Camilla, and flashed like fire across<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horse’s path, grabbed at the bridle, hauled him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To earth and shed his blood. A hawk in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not more quick to seize a dove when, driving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the dark rock toward lofty cloud, he fastens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The talons deep, and rips, and the feathers flutter,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That warrior rode, calling each man by name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driving his ranks to battle with fierce outcry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rallying beaten men to fight:&mdash;“What terror,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Tuscans, causes you such utter panic?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will nothing ever hurt you? Does a woman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chase you all over the field in this confusion?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do we carry swords? What silly weapons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are these in our right hands? You are swift enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wrestling in the night time, or for dances<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the curved flute of Bacchus does the piping!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have, it seems, one pleasure and one passion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting for feasts and goblets on full tables<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When priests announce the sacrifice propitious<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fat victim calls to the deep woodlands.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Tarchon had his say, and spurred his charger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself not loath to die, fell like a whirlwind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Venulus, and swept him from the saddle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifted him with his right hand, and held him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him as he rode, and all the Latins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheered with a noisy din that reached the heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The arms and man in front of him, over the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode Tarchon, swift as fire; broke off the point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Venulus’ spear, and sought a place unguarded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he might thrust a deadly wound; the other<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struggled against him, kept the hand from the throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matched violence with violence. An eagle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soaring to heaven, carries off a serpent<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_328" id="page_328">{328}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In just that manner, in the grip of talons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wounded reptile writhes the looping coils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rears the scales erect and keeps on hissing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the curved beak strikes at the struggling victim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, from the battle-line of the Etruscans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tarchon swept off his struggling prey in triumph,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An inspiration to his rallied people.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then Arruns, as the fates would have it, started<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stalking the fleet Camilla with the javelin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ahead of her in cunning. He took no chances,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking the easiest way. When that wild maiden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dashed fiercely into the battle, there he followed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stealthily in her footsteps, or turned the reins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she came back victorious. This way, that way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wary in each approach, he circled after,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sure spear quivering as he poised and held it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It happened Chloreus, Cybele’s priest, was shining<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off in Phrygian armor, spurring a horse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Covered with leather, scales of brass and gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rider was a fire of foreign color,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Launching his Cretan darts: the bow was golden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The helmet golden, and the cloak of saffron,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stiff it had a metal sound, was fastened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With knots of yellow gold; some foreign needle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had worked embroidery into hose and tunic.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Camilla picked him out from all the battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either to take that spoil home to the temple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or flaunt the gold herself; she was a huntress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In blind pursuit, dazzled by spoil, a woman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reckless for finery. In hiding, Arruns<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_329" id="page_329">{329}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught up his spear and prayed:&mdash;“Most high Apollo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soracte’s warden, whose adorers feed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pine-wood fire, and trustful tread the embers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me wipe out this shame. I seek no plunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No spoil, no trophy, of Camilla beaten;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I may perhaps find other ways to glory.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All I ask here is that this scourge may vanish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under a wound I give; for this I am willing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make return, however inglorious, home.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half of his prayer was heard: Apollo granted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The downfall of Camilla; the returning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe home was not to be,&mdash;the south winds carried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That much to empty air. So the spear, whirring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spun from his hand; the sound turned all the Volscians<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With anxious eyes and minds to watch their ruler.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She heard no stir in the air, no sound, no weapon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the sky, till the spear went to its lodging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the bare breast and drank the maiden blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her frightened comrades hurry, catch her falling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Arruns, frightened more than any other,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half joy, half fear, makes off: no further daring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is his, to trust the lance or face encounter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a wolf that kills a bullock or a shepherd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the darts can reach him, down the mountains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes plunging through the brush, the sign of guilt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tail clapped under the belly, bent on flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Arruns sneaks to cover through the armies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dying, she pulls at the dart, but the point is fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the wound between the ribs; her eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roll, cold in death; her color pales; her breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_330" id="page_330">{330}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes hard. She calls to Acca, her companion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most loved, most loyal:&mdash;“I have managed, Acca,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This far, but now&mdash;the bitter wound&mdash;I am done for,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are shadows all around. Hurry to Turnus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take him this last direction, to relieve me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in the fight, defend the town, keep off&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell!” The reins went slack, the earth received her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yielding her body to its cold, resigning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sagging head to death; and she let fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the last time, her weapons, and the spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went with a moan indignant to the shadows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then indeed the golden stars were smitten<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a wild outcry; with Camilla fallen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fight takes on new fierceness: all the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rush in, Etruscan leaders, all the squadrons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That came, once, from Evander.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">High in the mountains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opis, Diana’s sentinel, unfrightened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had watched the battle, and seen, through all that fury,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Camilla slain in pitiful death. She sighed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spoke with deep emotion:&mdash;“Cruel, cruel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The punishment you pay, poor warrior-maiden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that attempt to battle down the Trojans!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It comes to nothing, all the lonely service<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In woodland thicket, the worship of Diana,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wearing of our arrows on the shoulder.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even so, in the last hour of dying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your queen has not forsaken you, nor left you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhonored altogether; through the nations<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This will be known, your death, and with it, surely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_331" id="page_331">{331}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The satisfaction of vengeance. He whose wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Profaned your body will die as he deserves to.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the lofty mountain stood the tomb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an old king, Dercennus of Laurentum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mound of earth under a holm-oak’s shadow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here first the lovely goddess, sweeping down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From heaven, paused, and from that height watched Arruns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw him puffed with pride, exulting vainly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called:&mdash;“Why go so far away? Come nearer!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come to the death you merit; for Camilla<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive the due reward. Shall you die also<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under Diana’s weapons?” She drew an arrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift from the quiver of gold, drew back the bow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the curved ends were meeting, and her hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were even, left at arrow-tip and right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brushing her breast as she let loose the bow-string.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he heard the twang and the air whirring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt the steel strike home. Gasping and moaning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lay there in the unknown dust; his comrades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgot, and left him where he lay, and Opis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soared upward to Olympus.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">Camilla’s squadron<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was first to flee, their leader lost; Atinas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keen though he was, sped off; in reel and rout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rutulians followed; captains and troops uncaptained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shattered and broken, turned and wheeled their horses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a gallop toward the walls. No one can halt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans now, nor stand against the havoc;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They carry unstrung bows on nerveless shoulders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_332" id="page_332">{332}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the horses drum in the rush in the dust of the plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cloud of dust, black murk, rolls toward the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the watch-towers mothers wail to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beating their breasts, screaming in lamentation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first ones stumble through the gates; upon them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The enemy presses hard, and friend and foe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are all confused together. Men are dying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gasping away their lives on their own threshold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sight of home and shelter, unprotected<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within their native walls. Some close the gates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dare not admit their wretched comrades, pleading,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor take them to the town. And slaughter follows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most pitiful: the sword that guards the portals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kills citizens who try to rush in blindly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their parents, weeping, see them shut from the city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some, who are driven back, go rolling headlong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the trenches, and others, dashing wildly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With loosened rein, crash into gates and portals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Locked tight against them. Along the walls the mothers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Try to be fighters (love of country taught them)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as they saw Camilla do, fling weapons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With trembling hands, or grasp at stakes or oak-poles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do the work that steel should do, poor creatures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eager to die, before the walls, in the vanguard.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Meanwhile, to Turnus in his forest ambush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The terrible news is borne: Acca reports it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Volscian ranks destroyed, Camilla fallen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The enemy, deadly, massing thick, and sweeping<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(As Jupiter’s relentless will commanded)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsook the ambush in the hills, abandoned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rugged woodland, and scarcely had he done so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passing from sight to valley, when Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entered the pass in safety, crossed the mountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came out of the dark woods. And both were striving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reach the city, swiftly, in full column<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And almost side by side: in a single moment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas saw the plain and the dust rising<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Turnus saw Aeneas, fierce for battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the stamp and snorting of the horses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was almost time for fighting, but the Sun-god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Colored in crimson, brought his weary horses<br /></span>

<big>THE<br /> FINAL COMBAT</big></h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">As Turnus saw the Latins failing, broken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Mars against them, and all eyes upon him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awaiting the fulfillment of his promise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He burned with wrath, implacable, and lifted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His spirit high, as in the fields of Carthage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lion, sorely wounded by the hunters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fights harder for the hurt, the happier for it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mane rises on the neck and shoulders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the jaws break off the weapon, and the bloody mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roars out defiance, even so in Turnus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The violent spirit raged. He spoke to the king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In angry words:&mdash;“Turnus won’t keep them waiting;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No reason for these cowards to renounce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bargain. Start the holy ritual, father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrange the terms. I go to meet the Trojan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the Latins sit and watch it if they want to,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this right arm will send him down to Hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The renegade from Asia. I alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answer the argument that calls us cowards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_336" id="page_336">{336}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, with one single sword. Or we are beaten<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he takes Lavinia home.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">Latinus answered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With quiet in his heart:&mdash;“O youth, distinguished<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above them all in spirit, the more your courage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rises to fierceness, the more I find it needful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take slow counsel, to balance every hazard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have the kingdom of your father Daunus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a captured town; and I, Latinus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lack neither gold nor spirit. In our country<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are other girls, unwed, and not ignoble.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me say this&mdash;I know it is not easy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As frankly as I can, and listen to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was not right for me to give my daughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To any of her former native suitors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gods and men so prophesied. I loved you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turnus, and I gave in: we are related<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By blood, I know, and when Amata sorrowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I broke off every bond, cancelled the promise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took up unholy arms. From that day, Turnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see what wars pursue me, and what dangers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What sufferings you, above all men, submit to.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have been beaten twice in a great battle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now we hold, just barely, in our city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hopes of Italy. The streams of Tiber<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are warm with blood of ours, and the broad fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White with our bones. In what direction<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do I keep turning, back and forth? What madness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changes my purpose? If, with Turnus dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stand prepared to join them to me as allies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_337" id="page_337">{337}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why not, while he still lives, break off the conflict?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What will they say, all your Rutulian kinsmen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All Italy, if I (may fortune keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The word I say from coming true!) betray you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To death, the suitor of my only daughter?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consider war’s uncertainties, and pity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your aged father, far from us and grieving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Ardea, his homeland.” The king’s appeal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved Turnus not at all; his temper worsened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was aggravated by the attempt at healing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He managed, with an effort, to say something:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Most kindly father, the care you have for me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay down, for my sake; let me have permission<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To trade death for renown. I too, dear father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toss no mean dart, swing no mean sword, and blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follows the wounds I give. His goddess-mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will not be there, this time, to hide him, running<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the folds of her gown and cloud and empty shadows.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But Queen Amata, sick and almost dying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From fear of the new battle-chance, was weeping;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was the son she wanted; she would not let him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Risk that heroic life, and, clinging to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She made her plea:&mdash;“Turnus, our only hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our only comfort in our sad old age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pride and honor of Latinus’ kingdom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rest in your keeping, and our sinking house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Depends on you to shore it up from ruin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If tears of mine can move you, if my daughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Merits the least devotion, I implore you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I beg one favor: do not fight the Trojan!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_338" id="page_338">{338}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever danger waits you in that duel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awaits me also, Turnus; I shall leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hateful light when you do, I shall never<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be such a captive as to see Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come to my home as son-in-law.” Lavinia<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listened and wept and blushed, her maiden features<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffused with color, as the stain of crimson<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adds hue to Indian ivory, or lilies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lose something of their whiteness, mixed with roses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Turnus, troubled enough, was troubled further<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching the girl, and burned the more for battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spoke, however briefly, to Amata:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Do not, O mother, follow me with tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or any such omen as I go to battle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turnus can not delay his death.” He turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Idmon, then, and told him:&mdash;“Be my herald:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deliver to that Phrygian usurper<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These words from me&mdash;I know that he will hate them&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When dawn to-morrow, riding in the heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In crimson chariot, glows and reddens, let him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold back his Trojans, let their weapons and ours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have rest, let us end the war, two of us only;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There let Lavinia be sought, her husband<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victor on that field!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">And he went home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his own quarters, hurrying, demanding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His horses, given Pilumnus by Orithyia,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whiter than snow, swifter than wind. And he was happy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking at them, all spirit, as they nickered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing their master. The drivers stood about them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_339" id="page_339">{339}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grooming the manes, patting the chests. And Turnus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fits to his shoulders the stiff coat of armor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gold, the bronze, and tests the readiness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sword and shield and the horns of the ruddy crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vulcan had made the sword for Daunus, metal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glowing white-hot and plunged in Stygian water.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spear stood leaning on a mighty pillar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the great hall, a trophy won from Actor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seized it poised it, shook it, cried aloud:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Be with me now, good spear that never failed me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time has come. Let me lay low that body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let my tough hands rip off his coat of armor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me shove that eunuch’s crimped and perfumed tresses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the dust!” So he was driven by fury,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sparks leaping from his countenance, and fire<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of Rome to be, and from the camp Iulus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second hope of Roman greatness, followed.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the leaders faced the rising sun, and sprinkled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The salted meal, and marked the victims’ foreheads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With knives that took the holy lock, and poured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Libations on the altars, and Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawing his sword, made prayer:&mdash;“Sun, be my witness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Earth be witness to me in my praying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Earth, for whom I have been able to bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such toil and suffering, Almighty Father,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rivers and Fountains, too, I call, and Powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lofty Heaven and deep blue ocean, witness:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If victory comes to Turnus, the Trojans, beaten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go to Evander’s city, and Iulus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will quit these lands forever, and hereafter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No son or follower of Aeneas ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will rise again in warfare, or with sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attack these kingdoms. But if Victory grants us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I expect, and may the gods confirm it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win the battle, I will not have Italians<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be subject to the Trojans; I crave no kingdom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not for myself: let both, unbeaten nations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On equal terms enter eternal concord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will establish gods and ceremonial;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sire, Latinus, keep his arms, his sceptre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_343" id="page_343">{343}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans will build walls for me; Lavinia<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall give the city her name.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">And so Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made solemn pledge, and after him Latinus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting his eyes to heaven, and outstretching<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His right hand to the stars, confirmed the treaty:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“By these same Powers I swear, Aeneas, by Earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sea, Stars, Latona’s offspring, two-faced Janus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power of the world below, and Pluto’s altars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May the Almighty Father, who sanctions treaties<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lightning, hear my words: I touch the altars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I call these fires and presences to witness:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No day shall break this peace, this pact, Italians,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However things befall; no force shall turn me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From this intention, not if the force of deluge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confounded land and water, Heaven and Hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as this sceptre” (and he gestured with it)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Shall never bloom with leaf in branch or shadow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once it has left its forest-trunk, its mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lost to steel its foliage, a tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more, when once the artist’s hand has edged it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With proper bronze, for Latin sires to carry.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they affirmed the covenant, in sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of leaders and people, and duly, over the flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made sacrifice of victims, and tore out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The entrails while the beasts yet lived, and loaded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The altars high with offerings.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">But more and more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rutulian hearts were wavering; the fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to seem unequal, and they stirred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_344" id="page_344">{344}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shifted and doubted. And Turnus moved them strangely,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coming on silent footstep to the altar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking down humbly, with a meek devotion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheeks drawn and pale. Juturna heard the whispers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The muttered talk, and sensed the stir in the crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suddenly plunged into their midst, disguised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Camers, noble in birth and brave in arms, and son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a brave father. She knew what she was doing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Putting the fuel of rumor on the fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crying:&mdash;“Are you not ashamed, Rutulians,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one should be exposed for all this army?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In strength, in numbers, are we not their equal?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here they all are, the Trojans, the Arcadians,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Etruscans, all the lot of them: and we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are almost twice as many; man to man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two against one! But no: we are willing to let him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise to the skies on deathless praise; the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive him, by his own decision bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An offering at their altars, and we sit here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sluggish as stone on ground, our country lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ready to bow to any arrogant master.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are moved; at least the young are, and a murmur<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs through the ranks: the Latins and Laurentians<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are ripe for change. Rest from the war, and safety<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Count less than arms. They want the treaty broken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They pity Turnus. It’s not fair, this bargain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now Juturna adds a greater warning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sign from heaven, and nothing could have stirred them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With more immediate impetus to folly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, flying through the sky, an eagle, orange<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_345" id="page_345">{345}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the red light, was bearing down, pursuing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds along the shore, and they were noisy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In desperate flight, and the eagle struck, and the talons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seized the conspicuous swan. And as the Italians<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked up in fascination, all the birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most wonderful to tell, wheeled, and their outcry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clanged, and their wings were a dark cloud in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cloud that drove their enemy before them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, beaten down by force, by weight, the eagle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faltered, let go the prey, which fell to the river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the great bird flew far to the distant clouds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This omen the Rutulians cheered with shouting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hands that cry for action. And their augur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tolumnius, roused them further:&mdash;“I have prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Often for this, and here it is! I own it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I recognize the gods. With me as leader,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me, I say, take arms, unhappy people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom, like frail birds, the insolent marauder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frightens in war, despoils your shores. He also<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">He went rushing forward,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Struck where the belt was buckled over the belly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went on through the ribs. The brothers, angry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grieving, drew swords, or picked up spears in frenzy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went blindly rushing in, and the Latin columns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came charging at them; from their side the Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men from Agylla, brightly-armed Arcadians,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured in a rushing flood. One passion held them,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Staggering backward from that charge, and reeling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He falls upon the altars, there behind him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes down on head and shoulders. And like fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Messapus flashes toward him, spear in hand,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To pull the barb from the wound; the shaft had broken.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thing to do, he tells them over and over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The quickest way would be to cut around it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the sword do the probing, find the spear-point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No matter how deep it tries to hide, expose it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Get it out of there, and send him back to battle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Iapyx came to help, the son of Iasus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dearest beyond all others to Apollo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who once had offered him his arts, his powers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His augury, his lyre, the lore of arrows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Iapyx made another choice; his father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed, was dying, and he chose to save him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through what Apollo had the power to offer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowledge of simples and the arts of healing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so he chose the silent craft, inglorious.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So there was Iapyx, trying to be helpful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas, leaning on his spear, and cursing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indifferent to Iulus’ tears, and others<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing around, and anxious. The old doctor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tucked up his robe, compounded potent herbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Applied them, fussed around, all to no purpose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tried to extract the dart by hand, and then by forceps,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No luck at all: Apollo does not guide him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_351" id="page_351">{351}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more and more across the plains the horror<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thickens, and evil nears. They see the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing on dust; horsemen come on, and arrows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are falling thick, and a mournful din arises<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fighting men go down, with Mars relentless.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then Venus, shaken with a mother’s anguish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over a suffering son, from Cretan Ida<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plucked dittany, a plant with downy leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crimson blossom: the wild goats know and use it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As cure for arrow-wounds. This herb the goddess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought down, her presence veiled in cloud, and steeped it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With secret healing in the river-water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured in the shining caldrons, and she added<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambrosia’s healing juice, and panacea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And agèd Iapyx washed the wound, unknowing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The virtues of that balm, and all the pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly, and by magic, left the body;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood was staunched, deep in the wound; the arrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dropped from the flesh, at the least touch; the hero<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt all his strength return. “Quick! Bring his weapons!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iapyx cries out, the first to fire their spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the foe, “Why are you standing there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are you waiting for? These things have happened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By more than mortal aid or master talent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is not my hand, Aeneas, that has saved you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some greater god is working here, to send you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To greater deeds.” Aeneas, eager for battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had the gold shin-guards on while he was talking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes the spear flash, impatient, gets the armor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_352" id="page_352">{352}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buckled about the body, and the sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ready at the left side, and through the helmet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stoops down to kiss Iulus:&mdash;“Learn, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What I can show you, valor and real labor:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learn about luck from others. Now my hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will be your shield in war, your guide to glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To great rewards. When you are grown, remember;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Your father Aeneas and your uncle Hector.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So from the gates he rushed, a mighty warrior<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wielding a mighty spear, and all the column<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came pouring forth; Mnestheus, Antheus, others,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave the forsaken camp. The dust is blinding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the plain, the tramp of armies marching<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes the earth tremble, and from the opposite hillside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turnus and the Ausonians saw them coming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a cold chill ran through their bones; Juturna,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quicker than all the Latins, heard the sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knew it, and fled in terror. And Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushed his dark column over open country<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a cloud-burst sweeps to land across the ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And farmers know it, far away, and shudder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearful and sure of ruin to woods and cornfield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the winds fly on before the storm and herald<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roaring sound to the shore; so, like a cloud-burst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas brings his armies on; they gather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each company, at his side. Thymbraeus’ sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strikes down Osiris; Mnestheus slays Arcetius;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achates Epulo, and Gyas Ufens.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The armistice, lies low. A shout arises:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Rutulians turn back in rout; the dust-clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follow them over the field in flight. Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disdains to kill retreating men, refuses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attack on such as face him; it is Turnus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He watches for, hunts through the gloom of battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is Turnus, Turnus only, whom he summons.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And this Juturna knows, and in her panic<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She flings Metiscus, charioteer of Turnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the car, far from the reins and axle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And takes his place, plying the supple reins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls with Metiscus’ voice, assumes his armor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a dark swallow through a rich man’s mansion<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For the young birds at home, and now chirps under<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Even so, Juturna, by the horses carried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darts here and there, quarters the field, and proudly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes a great show of Turnus, her cheering brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet never lets him close in fight or grapple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever wheeling and turning. But Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is dogged in pursuit and loud in challenge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whenever he sees that car, and runs to meet it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Juturna shifts the course. What can he do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing, it seems, but boil in rage; one anger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes conflict in his heart against another.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Messapus comes against him; his left hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holds two tough lances, tipped with steel: advancing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He levels one, well-aimed; Aeneas crouches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On one knee under the shield, but the spear, flying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_354" id="page_354">{354}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Picks off the crested plume from the top of the helmet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas’ anger swells; this treachery rankles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Messapus’ chariot and steeds, withdrawing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are far away. He has made appeal to Jove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the broken treaty’s altars all too often,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now he fights in earnest; Mars beside him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rouses terrible carnage, giving anger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free rein: he makes no choice of opposition.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">In turn, drive victims over all the plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jupiter willed it so, that mighty nations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destined, in time, for everlasting friendship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should meet in that great struggle. A Rutulian,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sucro, held off Aeneas for a little,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And died more quickly, with the sword-point driven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through ribs’ protecting framework. Turnus met<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amycus, and unsaddled him; his brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diores, fought on foot, and Turnus killed them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one by spear, the one by sword; his chariot<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Aeneas, in one charge, brought down three warriors,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In Lerna’s rivers; his Arcadian dwelling<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">There was a man, Murranus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose pride of ancestry was loud and boastful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last of a line of Latin kings. Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought him to earth and laid him low; a stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mighty whirling rock served as the weapon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And under reins and under yoke the wheels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolled him along, and over him the horses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trampled in earth the lord they had forgotten.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hyllus rushed Turnus, and a javelin met him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the gold temple-band, and pierced the helmet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lodged there, in the brain. A brave man, Cretheus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had no defense against the might of Turnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no god saved Cupencus from Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No shield of bronze delayed the speeding weapon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeolus fell, stretched on the plains, a hero<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too powerful for all the Greek battalions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom even Achilles, overthrower of Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could not bring down. He reached his goal of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in Laurentum, a man whose home, Lyrnesus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay at the foot of Ida, but his tomb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was on Italian soil. So all the lines<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A change of purpose, to direct his column<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here, there, all up and down the columns, watching,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Come massing toward him, shield and spear held ready.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Let there be no delay: great Jove is with us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let no man go more slackly, though this venture<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is new and unexpected. That city yonder,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sky is dark with arrows. Toward the city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas lifts his hand, rebukes Latinus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calling the gods to witness that his will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not for battle, it was forced upon him<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The king himself to the ramparts. Others hurry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With arms, man the defenses. When a shepherd<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On to the city, where the blood goes deepest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the muddy ground, and the air whistles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flying spears. He makes a sudden gesture,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying aloud:&mdash;“No more, no more, Rutulians!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_361" id="page_361">{361}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold back your weapons, Latins! Whatever fortune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There may be here is mine. I am the one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not you, to make the treaty good, to settle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The issue with the sword. That will be better.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They all made way and gave him room.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">Aeneas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing the name of Turnus, leaves the city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsakes the lofty walls; he has no patience<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With any more delay, breaks off all projects,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exults, a terrible thunderer in armor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As huge as Athos, or as huge as Eryx,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or even father Apennine, that mountain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roaring above the oaks, and lifting high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His crown of shimmering trees and snowy crest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now all men turned their eyes, Rutulians, Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Italians, those who held the lofty ramparts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those battering at the wall below; their shoulders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were eased of armor now. And king Latinus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could hardly, in amazement, trust his senses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing these two big men, born worlds apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meeting to make decision with the sword.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plain was cleared, and they came rushing forward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurling, far off, their spears; the fight is on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bronze shields clang and ring. Earth gives a groan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swords strike hard and often; luck and courage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are blent in one. And as on mighty Sila<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or on Taburnus’ mountain, when two bullocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charge into fight head-on, and trembling herdsmen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall back in fear, and the herd is dumb with terror,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heifers, hardly lowing, stare and wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_362" id="page_362">{362}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which one will rule the woodland, which one the herd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will follow meekly after, and all the time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gore each other with savage horns, and shoulders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And necks and ribs run streams of blood, and bellowing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fills all the woodland,&mdash;even so, Aeneas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Daunus’ son clash shield on shield; the clamor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fills heaven. And Jupiter holds the scales in balance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With each man’s destiny as weight and counter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one the heavier under the doom of death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Confident, Turnus, rising to the sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full height, is a flash of light; he strikes. The Trojans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Latins, cry aloud and come up standing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the sword is treacherous; it is broken off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the blow half spent: the fire of Turnus finds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No help except in flight. Swift as the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He goes, and stares at a broken blade, a hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unarmed. The story is that in that hurry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rush of his, to arms, when the steeds were harnessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took Metiscus’ sword, not the one Daunus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had left him. For a while it served its purpose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the Trojans ran away, but when it met<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The armor Vulcan forged, the mortal blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Split off, like brittle ice, with glittering splinters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like ice on the yellow sand. So Turnus flies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Madly across the plain in devious circles:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">After the panting enemy, as a hound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Running a stag to bay, at the edge of the water<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And snaps his jaws, closes and grips, is shaken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Off from the flanks again, and once more closes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a great noise goes up the air; the waters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resound, and the whole sky thunders with the clamor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turnus has time, even in flight, for calling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud to Rutulians, each by name, demanding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In terrible rage, the sword, the sword, the good one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one he knows. Let anybody bring it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aeneas threatens, and death and doom await him,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In token of gratitude. For this the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cared nothing, lopped the branches off to clear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Through cloud from bowstring, armed with gall or poison,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We must fight with arms, not running. Take what shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will, gather your strength or craft; fly up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the high stars, or bury yourself in earth!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Turnus shook his head and answered:&mdash;“Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being my enemy, scares me, and the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not your hot words, fierce fellow.” And his vision,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glancing about, beheld a mighty boulder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A boundary-mark, in days of old, so huge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dozen men in our degenerate era<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could hardly pry it loose from earth, but Turnus<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Seems not to recognize himself, in running,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the words we try to utter come to nothing,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Blocked off, wherever he turns, however bravely.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All sorts of things go through his mind: he stares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the Rutulians, at the town; he trembles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quails at the threat of the lance; he cannot see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Any way out, any way forward. Nothing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chariot is gone, and the charioteer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Juturna or Metiscus, nowhere near him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spear, flung by Aeneas, comes with a whir<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Is low in pleading:&mdash;“I have deserved it, surely,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That belt with the bright studs, of evil omen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only to Pallas now, a sad reminder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deadly provocation. Terrible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wrath, Aeneas cries:&mdash;“Clad in this treasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This trophy of a comrade, can you cherish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hope that my hands would let you go? Now Pallas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas exacts his vengeance, and the blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Pallas, making sacrifice!” He struck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before he finished speaking: the blade went deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Turnus’ limbs were cold in death; the spirit<br /></span>

<h2><a name="VIRGILS_LIFE_AND_TIMES" id="VIRGILS_LIFE_AND_TIMES"></a>VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES</h2>

<p class="nind">Publius Vergilius Maro, whom we call Virgil, was born up north in Italy,
somewhere in the vicinity of Mantua, in the year 70 <small>B.C.</small> Julius Caesar,
that year, was a man of thirty. The poet’s father was a landholder,
sufficiently affluent to afford his son a pretty extensive course of
education. Virgil grew up to be tall, dark, perhaps a little rawboned
and loose-jointed, never very robust, quiet, no doubt, but with more fun
in him, and malice, too, if the ascription of the minor poems is
correct, than we sometimes think. As a youth, he studied first at
Cremona, then at Milan, and in this he was fortunate, for the scholars
of the north seemed to have laid more emphasis on the humanistic side of
education, on arts, letters, and philosophy, than did the
materialist-minded rhetoricians of Rome. To Rome, in his late teens,
Virgil did go for pre-legal study, for him a not very congenial
experience; it is on record, according to Donatus, that he pleaded
exactly one case, and that unsuccessfully. He was twenty-one when Julius
Caesar crossed the Rubicon, and the Civil War flared up between Caesar
and Pompey, and it seems probable that he was pressed into service with
Caesar’s forces, not too much against his political sympathies, however
distasteful to his temperament. His service was not long: the state of
his health may have brought him early leave or discharge; in his younger
twenties he turned to the study of philosophy at Naples.</p>

<p>He found good teachers there, Siro, Philodemus, highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_374" id="page_374">{374}</a></span> trained men of
the Epicurean school, versed not only in Greek thought but familiar,
also, with the wisdom of the East. He found good fellow-students, too, a
remarkable list of influential Romans, men who were to be his lifelong
friends, as Naples was to be made his permanent home, in spite of
traveling, later, and the honor of an official residence at Rome. Naples
was a pleasant place to be during those years, above the battles that
broke and raged not only up and down the peninsula, but to east and
west, in Spain, in Gaul, in Thessaly, in Africa. The republican
institutions which had sufficed an agrarian economy were breaking down
under the pressures of the new rising mercantile and almost industrial
society; there had even been something like a primitive proletarian
revolution under Spartacus; no Epicurean scorn for political ambitions
could keep men’s consciences from being deeply troubled. Virgil,
conservative at heart, yet with a great admiration for Julius Caesar the
man, seems not to have been too bitter about the imminence of a
dictatorship; he would have preferred it not to be so called, and he
hoped, with all his soul and spirit, that it would be wisely and
mercifully administered, and he said so. He was twenty-six when Caesar
was assassinated on the Ides of March in 44 <small>B.C.</small>, and the shock of that
event was enough to drive from his mind the ideas he had formed, in a
groping and immature wishfulness, of writing a national epic.</p>

<p>Virgil was not much over thirty when his first substantial work was
given publication. This consisted of the Eclogues, or Bucolics, ten
longish poems, ostensibly pastoral, modelled, to a certain extent, on
the Greek poet Theocritus. These poems were by no means purely escapist<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_375" id="page_375">{375}</a></span>
literature; they were full of allusions to recent political events,
sympathy for the victims of civil war, appeals to the victors for
compassion, gratitude that the patrimonial estates had suffered less
severely than some others under the policy of rewarding the veterans
with places on the land. The young Octavian, victor, with Mark Antony,
over the Caesaricides Brutus and Cassius at Philippi, was impressionable
enough to be guided in decent ways, following his great-uncle’s
tradition of clemency; and Octavian, on his part, was sufficiently
tactful, as well as shrewd, to want to have the poets on his side. The
great success of the Eclogues rendered it highly desirable that Virgil,
along with other poets, be given something like official status; the
wealthy counsellor Maecenas, patron of the arts and member of the inner
circle, put a villa in his own gardens at the poet’s disposal. Here
Virgil found new friends, notably the poet Horace, five years his
junior&mdash;it lay much to the credit of Octavian’s decency that place could
be made for a young satirist who had fought against him at Philippi
(probably not very hard, if we can believe Horace’s own account) and
whose published work had been caustic about the government. So Virgil
had security, recognition, freedom to travel with the distinguished on
official journeys, or to come and go as he pleased, with the privilege
of staying, whenever he was so minded, in his quieter gardens near
Naples.</p>

<p>It was nearly a decade before the publication of his next major work,
the Georgics, a long poem, in four books, on the subject of husbandry.
Those returned veterans, settled by tens of thousands on the land, knew,
it seemed, little of farming, and, for that matter, probably cared less.
It was Virgil’s responsibility, under Octavian’s sanc<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_376" id="page_376">{376}</a></span>tion, to instruct
them, to see to it that they should both know and care, have practical
information as to what must be done with crops and cattle and bees, and
at the same time develop faith and pride in what they were doing, return
to the simple virtues of the fathers, the good old republican ways. For
all its official status, however, the poem was just a little too honest
to be what we should consider ideal propaganda. There is no sentimental
rapture in the Georgics, no idolization, idealization, or idyllization
of what life on a farm is like; the sober-minded citizen, in fact, might
easily be dissuaded from agriculture entirely by the accurate
description of the various kinds of hell farming would put him through.</p>

<p>By the time Virgil was putting the finishing touches to this book, the
unsettled condition of the Roman state had begun to change for the
better. A decade’s opposition to Octavian, led by the sons of Pompey and
his old partner Antony, had come to an end with the defeat of Antony and
Cleopatra at the battle of Actium in 31 <small>B.C.</small> The East and West could
join again; there could now be one world, under the tempered principate
of the man who had matured from the young Octavian into Caesar Augustus.
And Virgil could turn to the project he had never forgotten, fulfill the
longings that, as allusions in both Eclogues and Georgics had shown,
still occupied at least his unconscious mind, the composition of an epic
poem that should justify this great nation, remind her citizens of all
she had cost, inspire them to be worthy of their tradition. To this
work, the Aeneid, Virgil devoted the rest of his life. He did not ever
consider it finished; he had still three years’ work ahead of him, he
estimated, when he went to Greece, at the age of fifty, to study more
carefully the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_377" id="page_377">{377}</a></span> scenes of the book in which he described the wanderings
of Aeneas. There he fell ill, was brought back to Brundisium, on the
heel of Italy, where he died in 19 <small>B.C.</small> In his dissatisfaction with the
unfinished state of his work, he left instructions that the manuscript
of the Aeneid should be burned; Augustus, however, in the words of Tenny
Frank, “interposed the supreme authority of the state to annul that
clause of the will.” No dictator, ever, has exercised a happier veto.</p>

<h2><a name="CAST_OF_CHARACTERS" id="CAST_OF_CHARACTERS"></a>CAST OF CHARACTERS</h2>

<p>In the fighting between the Greeks and Trojans around Troy, Virgil calls
both sides by tribal names as well as national names, and sometimes uses
patronymics: thus the Greeks are also called Achaeans, Argives, Danaans,
Dolopes, Ithacans, Myrmidons, and so on; and the Trojans are called
Dardanians, Ilians, Teucrians, Phrygians. I have used these terms much
less than Virgil did, and tried, for the sake of avoiding confusion and
clutter, to stick to the terms Greek and Trojan, wherever possible.</p>

<p>Likewise, in the wars between the Trojans and Latins in Italy, we find
the enemies of Aeneas described as Italians, Latins, Rutulians, and
Etruscans. But there were also some Etruscans on his side; these were
led by Tarchon, the anti-Aeneas faction by Mezentius. His other
principal allies were the Arcadians, whose king was Evander.</p>

<p>The principal Greek warriors were Agamemnon, Menelaus, Ulysses,
Diomedes, and Ajax; the most conspicuous on the Trojan side Aeneas,
Hector, and possibly Paris.</p>

<p>Of the gods and goddesses, Juno, in the Aeneid, is actively opposed to
Aeneas, and Venus equally active on his behalf. Apollo gives the Trojans
considerable help with counsel, especially in the course of their
wanderings; Vulcan makes armor for Aeneas when he arrives in Italy, and
Neptune helps put down a storm that all but wrecked the Trojan fleet.
Jupiter maintains neutrality, in so far as the pressure applied by Venus
and Juno will permit.</p>
